SWeL Restaurant,jill g.,"SWeL is a place i've been wanting to try and v was worried that my expectations would be too high. They weren't. Holy carp, this place! Atmosphere-wise it's charming. dark but not too dark. cozy but not cramped. cute decor, but they aren't trying too hard. etc.
service gets an A+. fast, friendly, accommodating, knowledgeable. we never felt left alone but they were not intrusive.
drinks were perfect. the greyhound was so full of fresh grapefruit that i'm skipping my vitamin C pill tomorrow.
and the food, amazing. goat cheese crostini app w/tapenade? yum. pasta? so yum. sockeye salmon? perfectly cooked.
don't wait. go."
SWeL Restaurant,Kelli M.,"I'll start off by saying our server was great, establishment was cute, but..I was FAR from impressed with the food @ this place. I called ahead to ensure they could accommodate vegans and they assured me they had a few great options. We get there for dinner w/a group and my husband and I decided upon a ""loaded"" veggie pizza without cheese to make it easy. Our pizza came out. It consisted of VERY little mushroom and onions (like, extremely scarce) and was completely covered entirely with dry arugula. Really? The pizza was paper thin. It was the most disappointing veggie pizza I've EVER seen a restaurant put together. To top that, we got the bill and saw they charged $18 for it!! No joke, we had multiple slices that had nothing on it but tomato sauce..‍
‍
Morale of the story. Vegan community: I DO NOT recommend this place.
**Update in response to owner message**
As a customer, I have every right to give my personal opinion on any and every establishment. I did just that, and had the owner tell me that I'm standing on a soap box yelling to the public and he's tired of unhappy customers ""running to their mother"". Really?! May I suggest learning more about customer acquisition and retention? To be quite frank, I shouldn't have to complain when I get my food. I made it very clear that we were vegan before arriving AND at the restaurant when conversing with server. Your establishment took it upon yourself to make us a ""vegan"" pizza that had two vegetables on it. Way to go over and beyond the first time around. I guess it's my fault tho since I didn't complain, right? It's ridiculous that you can't let someone give their honest opinion without passively aggressively insulting them.
Also, to set the record straight, when we spoke on the phone, I never said I was getting the sandwich, I was just asking about the options we had. I do appreciate you going out of your way (if you really did) to PCC, But honestly, that's part of being a business owner. You do what it takes to create an environment where guest satisfaction is your highest priority. If someone isn't happy, you don't attack them..
I'm so appalled at your response to my review."
SWeL Restaurant,Sarah P.,"Food: At the bar, we ordered the baked goat cheese appetizer (a log of goat cheese rolled in pistachios and served with crostini for spreading and a side of fig kalamata olive tapenade, everything was amazing except the toast was maybe too toasted for how thick it was which made it harder to eat, the only negative comment of the night). We also ordered drinks, a basil gimlet for me (gin, basil, lime, it was SO GOOD) and a mezcal jalapeno margarita for Mike (they made it extra spicy for him which was great).
Once we were seated at our table, we ordered the chopped salami salad (salami, provolone, garbanzo beans, tomato, red onions, iceberg lettuce + red leaf, small ribbons of kale, plus a creamy tarragon vinaigrette that was just delicious), the Italian sausage pizza (I think I was drunk I don't even like sausage pizza why did I order this? But this one was very good), plus the mushroom pasta (fresh tagliatelle with shiitake, oyster and crimini mushrooms plus a white wine sauce, probably the best thing). Overall the food was awesome.
Staff: Super friendly! We had a reservation, but when we arrived the place was packed and the table before us was taking longer than expected, so we sat at the bar for a while. It felt like the entire staff was in on the situation, they kept checking in on us and making fun of the slow eaters, basically celebrating when we finally got our table. It was pretty funny.
Ambiance: Nice. Dark lighting, cool decor, pretty bar, felt cozy and updated."
SWeL Restaurant,Zachary B.,"OMG, fabulous is the only word. The food was INCREDIBLE, the service was personable and kind, the drinks were perfect. I can't think of any way the experience could have been elevated. The inside feels intimate and cozy, and just makes you feel like you're at home. I had a pasta dish that was really yummy and had a nice spice to it. The Caesar salad was awesome, super super garlicky, so if you aren't into that, you won't like it. Heads up, it's huge, and they can't split it in the kitchen. Our waitress split it for us at the table, but if sharing you may have to plate it up for yourselves. No biggie. Definitely worth the trip out of the city."
SWeL Restaurant,Hannah D.,"I came to SWeL with my boyfriend and friend. The moment we walked in, we had the best service. Scott went above and beyond to make sure we had an amazing experience. If you are serviced by Scott, you are in for a treat! I highly recommend the Calamari appetizer and Prosciutto pizza. Both are fresh and full of flavor. If you are looking for a tasty drink, I highly recommend the Gin and Juice. It will change your life. I would say this restaurant is good for a date night, celebration, or night with friends."
SWeL Restaurant,Crystel T.,"Honestly, one of the best restaurants in Seattle - from service, food to just overall atmosphere.
My husband came in on a Saturday night after joining the waitlist on Yelp. When we got in, the hostess was super nice and seated us within a few minutes.
Our server (I wish I remembered his name) was very friendly and answered any questions we had. He helped choose an awesome red wine that paired well with the pork chop dish. The cocktail he made for my husband was also delicious (it had basil in it), and I'm not typically a cocktail person!
Now the food. We ordered the calamari appetizer and it did not disappoint. To our surprise, it was spicy; but the heat was just right. What we like was that we could tell it was fresh and it wasn't so heavily breaded. In a lot of restaurants, often their calamari is breaded, greasy and you can tell it's frozen. The pork chop was just pure perfection! The chop was cooked so well - tender and juicy; and I was so in love with the Marsala sauce. My mouth is watering as I'm writing this, lol. Compliments to their chef who create that delicious sauce. My husband ordered the salmon and he too was happy with his dish.
For dessert, we ordered the bread pudding and the chocolate chip cooking with ice cream. Now, while the cookie was good; I really enjoyed the bread pudding! It's funny, my husband and I were visiting NOLA a few months ago, and bread pudding is pretty much s staple there. We ate so much of it and I had doubts SWeL's would come close to being as good. A lot of people may disagree with me, but the bread pudding at SWeL's was the best bread pudding I've ever had! The bread was tasty and not soggy like at some places; and I thought the pears really balanced the dish out.
Overall, we were very happy with the food and service. We've lived in Fremont for 3 years now and we regret that we've only been to SWeL once! We can't wait to go back!"
SWeL Restaurant,Khang B.,"Came in for a work lunch and chose the sandwich that had the Italian meats in it.
So worth it. The bread is so crisp yet easy to bite into. They love their serranos here and it's very welcome. Love the kick it provides! These people really know how to make sandwiches.
Can't wait to come back and try their dinner."
SWeL Restaurant,Jeremy S.,"This place is pretty good. I went here for a date and it was definitely the right ambiance for it. The area is cozy, the staff is friendly, and the lighting is dim. I ordered some wine, pizza, scallops, and a goat cheese salad. Keep in mind the scallops are more of a cheese dish that is melted with scallops. I thought it was going to be more of pieces of scallops with some cheese on them. The food as a whole was pretty good, I'd give it a 4/5... nothing that was a must have again.
Reservations were pretty quick and easy since you can do it online.
Overall, I'd definitely recommend this place to go for a date night or night out with friends! The food is decent and the ambiance is great and chill."
SWeL Restaurant,Emma V.,"Going to a class at Theo tonight at 6:30, so we looked up best happy hour in Fremont. This place was top of the list, and it's well deserved! I had vodka and a Seattle soda diet cola, my husband had the imperial oatmeal stout, both were fantastic. We had carne tacos, an Italian sausage pizza, and the organic chicken sandwich. I was in love with the pizza and the tacos, but not as much for the sandwich, despite it being filling! One thing to note is that the Italian sausage pizza came with a lot of mushrooms on it. It was still delicious, but a note in the menu would have been appreciated. The carne tacos were phenomenal, but very little food for $12. I think the best value was the sandwich, which was huge, and also came with chips."
SWeL Restaurant,Jenny K.,"Stopped by for Tuesday afternoon happy hour by the bar. We ordered the calamari, oven fired scallops, pepperoni pizza, & the prosciutto pizza. It was perfect for 2 of us since the happy hour pizza's aren't too big. The server was very nice and answered all the questions we had.
My favorite was the oven fired scallops. It came with a side of sliced baguette and it was the perfect pair to the scallops. Be careful! It's really hot!
Calamari: It was surprisingly big and the lime juice on top and arugula on bottom. It wasn't just a plain plate of calamari.
Pizzas: We preferred the prosciutto over the pepperoni but both were still delicious. The prosciutto pizza had a slight sweetness that we enjoyed. Loved the mushrooms on the pepperoni."
SWeL Restaurant,Tammy L.,"This was a 5 star experience. The staff was nice and friendly, the restaurant was clean, and the food was amazing. I ordered the goat cheese appetizer, and ate it alll to myself. I will say that I think the menu described this as being accompanied by crostini, but it was actually sliced baguette.... I also ordered the pepperoni pizza. The price was okay, not untrainable, but not cheap. The pizza was delicious. The crust was thin and light. The pepperoni was crispy..yum! And I ordered the caesar salad, which was well dressed and delicious. I want to back here again tonight!!!
The only problem is that the space is small and so are the tables. If you have 4 people all ordering food, the table gets really crowded....but that's not so important when the food is bomb."
SWeL Restaurant,Meagan I.,"This place was too cute not to try when we visited.
The atmosphere is intimate and perfect for a date.
However........ Called in to see if a reservation was necessary. I don't know if it was too loud for the girl to hear or she was new. I asked if it was busy and if I needed a reservation for that night two hours later. She said it wouldn't be bad but took the reservation anyway. We showed up two hours later to no reservation. Luckily we were sat right away regardless. I received a text the next day for a reservation; we had left the state by then.
Once we got our table, a bartender asked if we were ready to order but we needed another minute. No one came back for 20 minutes until we flagged someone down. All tables around us had their drink and food orders taken and were check on multiple times. Half hour later the bartender came back. Cool.
Luckily, the food is worth it. We started with the CHEESY SCALLOP appetizer. It was piping hot and super delicious. Swerved with some toasted bread. I couldn't stop eating!
CALAMARI came out the same time and it did not disappoint. We loved that it wasn't breaded. It was cooked perfectly and the seasoning was great.
The SEAFOOD PASTA was amazing. Loved the sauce. It was creamy and perfect. The seafood was plentiful and cooked well. I would definitely go back for the food."
SWeL Restaurant,Lynn B.,"A lovely chill atmosphere with soothing, breezy, jazzy music, great cocktails and gourmet versions of pizza, pastas, Cesar salad and more. A lovely grown up place to enjoy with your special someone. We will definitely be back. We had.....the caesar salad starter ... with a light and fresh version of homemade cesar dressing, the hand tossed pizza with pears, gorgonzola and pine nuts ... the crust was light and crunchy without tasting like a cracker..still had that nice yeasty flavor of a thicker crust, and the tagliatelle creamy herbed sauce with Homemade Italian sausage added...just the right amount of fennel. Super delicious! A perfect date night spot. Or, if you're by yourself or just chilling with a friend, there's lots of bar space and really friendly staff. Knowledgeable bartenders too. Nice selection of craft beers, wines and cocktails."
SWeL Restaurant,Jenny G.,"Food is all delicious. My friend had a pizza and it came out with a bottle of chili oil (genius) to drizzle. I had the Caesar salad and it was great. The large was a perfect entree size and I could have added protein if I'd been more hungry, including salmon or shrimp for those of us avoiding meat/poultry. The waitstaff was friendly and professional. The atmosphere was nice though we were there on a slow night, I think it would feel a bit cramped if full. The music (like most restaurants these days) was too loud but our waitress was happy to turn it down a bit when we asked. The only let down was the wine list. By-the-glass selections were limited, it was all overpriced, and the pours were stingy. I had the most expensive red (we were celebrating) and the waitress said it was by far the best of the options (there were only three) at $15 a glass. It was meh. The others were $10.
Overall would definitely go again to eat, but would get a beer :)"
SWeL Restaurant,Ashley B.,Super cute place to go for date night. We went for dinner on a Saturday and were super impressed with our server. She explained the menu but didn't over do it and we felt zero pressure. We ended up each getting a glass of wine and splitting a Caesar salad and the pepperoni pizza. Both SO good. The pizza was a thinner crust too so we didn't feel stuffed which was a bonus. We'll definitely be going back!
SWeL Restaurant,Odulami B.,I thought we were going to a great pizza joint bu SWeL turned out to be so much more. Great location for a group celebration or a fun date night. The pIZZA WAS PHENOMENAL bUt not the best thing on the menu in my book. The Chicken and Carne Asada entrees were delicious. The humus is a must as an appetizer which outshined the bruschetta. The Mint gin Julep tops their lists of creative libations. Make a reservation if you want to spend your time wisely.
SWeL Restaurant,Ryan S.,"The food and atmosphere were fabulous. The menu was simple, yet very complete. We sat down with friends for a night out on the town. They had an excellent wine list with a broad range of wines and specialty drinks. The food items were fabulous. We ordered the Hummas as an appetizer and a pizza for the main course. Both were excellent (presentation and taste). And the service was outstanding as well. Our server was helpful, but other members of the staff were constantly around and ensuring we were taken care of.
Highly..highly recommended. We will be back."
SWeL Restaurant,Arielle F.,"Stopped in on a Thursday night for dinner. My friend and I were in the mood for something light so...we obviously landed on wood fire pizza! :)
We were seated right away and the service throughout dinner was great. I got the pepperoni pizza and my friend got the Italian sausage. We both had a few glasses of wine (hey, what's pizza without wine, am I right?) and split the flourless mousse at the end. The food was really excellent - the pizza was cooked perfectly with a thin crispy crust with just enough sauce and toppings to leave us satisfied but not overly full! The mousse was smooth and rich but also surprisingly light.
The space inside is super cute. Other reviews mentioned it was too dark but I thought the ambience was good and it's beautifully decorated. I will be back!"
SWeL Restaurant,Megan R.,"Wow, just so good! Ambience super sexy. Service very welcoming and friendly. Food, WOW!
I guess Swel means ""shit we like"" and that's the theme of their menu. Love it!
Pizza good and the linguini is very flavorful and so much seafood.
BUT the scallop dip is out of control! Tried once as an app and it brought me back for dinner last night. It's creamy, perfect citrus, spice and just so different but I keep wanting more!
Been twice, both time we've had good experiences. I would recommend for sure."
SWeL Restaurant,Diksha N.,"A dim lighted - romantic restaurant which beckons for date nights. I came here for my birthday and we were seated in the individual cabana seating. We had rosè and some red wine with the beet salad which was lovely and very flavorful.
The service was excellent and prompt. We had the pear and gorgonzola pizza ( such a delicious pairing) one of the most exquisite combinations I could not have fathomed.
For dessert we had the bread pudding against my usual chocolate cravings. The waitress put a candle for my birthday. A little too sweet for my taste but my husband polished it off !."
Zig Zag Cafe,Jessica M.,"I was traveling alone for business and wanted a relaxed, upbeat place to grab dinner and a drink at the bar. This place fit the bill with great food and a fun vibe. The staff was very friendly and helpful, especially when they mailed the shopping bag I left behind back to me in Philadelphia.
I will definitely make sure to stop back in the next time I'm in town."
Zig Zag Cafe,Jenny Z.,"Came here tonight for an impromptu dinner date and left very satisfied. This place, besides being slightly hard to find, is the cutest little nook in downtown Seattle. You feel as if you're in a completely different world vs the touristy pike place corridor.
We arrived around 6:55 PM and were pleasantly surprised it was still happy hour. The deal is actually quite good - $4 off cocktails! I ordered a mezcal cocktail (what's new?) and husband ordered old fashioned. We asked for them less sweet and they turned out great. Mine had a ginger syrup which was different vs most mezcal cocktails I've ordered!
For food, ordered brussel sprouts and beet deviled eggs to start, and split the mussels and burger for the mains. The brussel sprouts were recommended by the server. They were good, not great. Felt like I could make them myself and wouldn't order again for $12. The deviled egg was the perfect party in my mouth and something I had never tasted before! It had a slice of anchovy in it which sounds odd but tasted amazing. Burger was perfectly cooked with a nice crispy bun. The fries were cooked crisp to perfection. Mussels were in perhaps the best sauce I've ever had.
Overall food was so tasty, service was quick and attentive despite restaurant being completely full, and menu comprehensive! Will come back for sure - especially now that we know HH runs until 7 pm on weekdays!"
Zig Zag Cafe,Vincent C.,"I came to Zig Zag for dinner and had a great experience in the end. My visit didn't start off great, though. The service was slow. On the night I was at Zig Zag, the restaurant was no more than 50% full. Nevertheless, I still waited nearly 25 minutes for my food.
That being said, the food was definitely worth the wait. I had the Wild Mushroom Farro, and it was the best farro I've ever had in my life! The flavor was completely balanced, with no one ingredient dominating the dish. I was also impressed with how they incorporated huckleberry into the dish. On top of that, the sauce - which I'm told was just vegetable stock with butter - was phenomenal. My only minor complaint was that some of the cauliflower was burnt. But the dish was so perfect in every other way that I can definitely overlook the cauliflower."
Zig Zag Cafe,Yael G.,"Met a friend here for some cocktails and it was really nice. I appreciated the vibe and that it wasn't super crazy loud. We got to hang out at a standing table and order our first drink before a table opened up, but it wasn't long until one did even though it was Friday night. The drink selection was awesome, and everything we ordered was great (and cleverly named). We also enjoyed our reasonably priced olives and Marcona almonds... good food, great drinks, nice vibe..."
Zig Zag Cafe,Melanie Y.,"Came here for a drink Saturday night.
Cool, chill, vibe. Super low key. Little bit hidden but follow the signs down the stairs. We didn't have to wait and were seated right away. We got two cocktails and be warned they are super strong.
They have a large selection of different kinds of drinks as well as a late night menu. We didn't try any of the food but it all looked amazing."
Zig Zag Cafe,Susan R.,"Wow what a great find on a work trip! There's so many places to choose from right here in the Pike Place Market area. Lucky me, I landed at Zig Zag!
Service from Anna and Erin was spot on a dm fabulous. Technically, I believe Anna was my server yet Erin bought several things and was very attentive as well. It kinda worked as tag team service and that was just fabulous!
All the food was spot on, they had plenty of gluten-free options and the happy hour wine was very good.
My only complaint is that I ate way too much because the food was so great! My hotel is around one plus miles ...uphill. Ugh. It'll be good for me, right?!? Super good, I'll be back!"
Zig Zag Cafe,Alex O.,"This place savings grace is there zig zag burger with the fried egg. That was absolutely delicious. The yolk just gushed out everywhere. Felt like I was eating a breakfast sandwich one minute and then the next second a bacon cheese burger. Also the cheese just oozed out of everywhere. Very delicious. The fries were a bit too salty for my taste though. Score: 5/5
Their snacks were very boring. The baguette with the cultured butter was good though. It comes toasted but my only compliant is that I eat too fast and the outside of the bread is too hard :(
The cheese platter was smelly!!!! It's not my cup of tea but I'm sure other people will love it"
Zig Zag Cafe,Sidong H.,"As a tourist to Pike Market, it was fun to dig out this hidden gem. My bar tender friend suggest me here for cock tails. And yes, def a great spot for happy hour drinks then a walk around to enjoy the sunset.
The drink menu is huge, and the bartender is quite knowledgable about almost everything. I like the atmosphere too, as a weekday early evening, it's already a full house, towns of locals and tourists like me here for their happy hour.
I would def come back and try more items."
Zig Zag Cafe,Tomoko R.,"What a hidden(?) gem!
Great cozy restaurant and their service was fantastic. Small selections of wines but they were really good wines and reasonable.
Ordered A charcuterie plate, fried oysters, burgers and mussels. The plate was so tasty and the meats were perfectly cured, their mousse was just melt in my mouth.
Mussels were so plumped and juicy. Creamy curry? Sauce was as good as mussels. Their burgers were seasoned right and right size. Not to small or big.
Fried oysters were my fave. Small size and sweet. Everything we ordered was just divine. I would go back there for HH next time. Sooo laidback vibes and the foods were excellent!!"
Zig Zag Cafe,Erik B.,"Looking for a classy, undercover jazz cafe with dim lighting, friendly staff and sleek design that totally takes you away from everyday life? Your answer: Zig Zag Cafe. Skillfully tucked away from Pike's Place market, close to the waterfront, Zig Zag offered superbly crafted cocktails and the perfect aperitif options to take a breather prior to continuing our tour of the city.
The lighting is dimly lit with old antique bottles of wine (some unopened) and cozy red lighting that makes you feel stuck in time. Each table is decked out with a candle as humble chandeliers decorate the ceilings.
We ordered a dish of deliciously tasting green & black olives with the perfect amount of garlic and zest. Complimented by a dish of pita bread and heated hummus (spiced with paprika and garlic), the food was delicious! For my cocktail, I ordered an aperol spritz - aperol campari mixed with good quality prosecco and orange zest with enough punch to keep me going.
Overall outstanding dining experience. Highly recommend! A+"
Zig Zag Cafe,Cassandra C.,"I had a great experience here. I've heard a lot of good things about Zig Zig and I'm so happy I've finally made my way there to experience it myself. I ate the fries and deviled eggs off their late night menu. I loved the sultry smokey ambiance and the bartender was great. I just loved watching the art that goes into crafting their perfect cocktails. I had a simple Moscow mule, perhaps next time I'll try one of their house cocktails. The deviled eggs were so yummy! Maybe I'll be back soon to try more food!"
Zig Zag Cafe,Rica R.,Went with a small group of friends last night and we were seated pretty quickly. Drinks aren't super cheap but you definitely get your money's worth. Shared a squid pro quo and it was delicious. Only negative I would mention is that we were sitting near the door and it was a bit chilly.
Zig Zag Cafe,Jessica C.,"Nice atmosphere, wait staff prompt and friendly. Food was good. The fried clams and mussels were great. The whisky drinks even better. I love the red lighting and music."
Zig Zag Cafe,Owen W.,"Even though I'm a life long Seattleite, last night was my first time to the Zig Zag Café. The area around Pike Place is incredible now that the viaduct has been demolished, and I hope local businesses benefit from that. I loved the Zig Zag Café, excellent drinks, good food and great staff. Our server was very friendly and very accommodating when I realized too late that I had ordered something that didn't agree with my tastes. Much appreciated, and I won't wait so long for my next visit!"
Zig Zag Cafe,Cindy G.,"Dark and cozy, with delicious bites and strong cocktails. We had deviled eggs, the pork skins, and almonds and olives for snacks before dinner at Cutters. The eggplant dip with the pork skins was the highlight. It was silky smooth, and not like baba ganouj, if that's what you were thinking. There's an off-menu cocktail-with-a-story, if you're interested. Called the Chas, it's bourbon, Cointreau, and other potent tastiness. A Pike Place institution, you must come to Zig Zag if you're in Seattle."
Zig Zag Cafe,Adam C.,"We stumbled upon this restaurant walking from pikes place down the water before heading over the smith tower. Zig Zag has the best mixologist in Seattle with a wide range of spirits. The food was wonderful, the staff was great and it's in a good location. The mixed drinks were excellent. An eggplant dish was superb, perfectly cooked and with the right garnish. The place is very cozy and very relaxing. The server was great in giving suggestions and the drinks were great."
Zig Zag Cafe,Erin R.,"BEST HAPPY HOUR. So many fun drinks and yummy snacks. They have one of the most extensive cocktail menus I've ever seen and it was hard to decide on just one (okay, two) to try. For snacks we had the fries which have a great balance of salt and dress black pepper and the crispy pig skin which came with a fantastic aioli.
We arrived around 5:30 and were able to get a seat on their small patio, but the inside looked nice too if the patio is full."
Zig Zag Cafe,Alex P.,Definitely a place to visit and hang around. The barman was the best. And I don't even drink!
Zig Zag Cafe,AJ C.,Great place for a drink at dusk....very nice selection of drinks and food. Bartenders very knowledgeable
Zig Zag Cafe,Andrea G.,Had appetizers and drinks with a friend. Tasty all around! Fun little spot and nice patio area.
The Pink Door,Kevin M.,"An amazing, lovely restaurant with a beautiful view on the inside and out.
Came here for a special occasion with my S.O. Started with a half bottle of local wine and their meat and cheese board. The meats varied from fatty, to hard, to spicy, to earthy. The cheeses were a medium and a soft cheese. Sides of spicy mustard and slightly sweet jam. This was a delicious board that we almost finished in its entirety.
For dinner I had the rigatoni with meatballs. And she had the lasagna. Mmmm the rigatoni was cooked perfectly, with just enough of a bite. The sauce was bright and fresh, if not a bit sour. I would personally add a bit of sugar to offset, but it was delicious nonetheless.
I had a few bites of the lasagna, I have tasted few lasagnas that come close. The spinach gave the pasta an elegant green hue, and their cheese was melted to a perfect cream consistency. The layer of pesto really gave this dish the richness that made it so special. Highly recommend the lasagna.
Finally, we finished off with espresso and their cheesecake. The cheesecake was hazelnut flavored and was very good. The hazelnut creme was just sweet enough. If you are a fan of hazelnut you will like this. Otherwise I could have done with a different flavor cheesecake.
Overall the food was fantastic. And the location and decor made dinner that much more special. I couldn't imagine a cozier restaurant. Dinner felt intimate. And the service was good. I will be back!"
The Pink Door,Ryan J.,"The Pink Door is as amazing as everyone else claims it to be! From the unseemly entrance to the beautiful view and decor, this place has earned its prestige as one of the best Italian restaurants around.
With a place that is so well known in Seattle, they are quite humble with their entrance. Walking thru a not so busy alley, if you see a Pink Door you've arrived at the right place. Upon entry, you can see the cozy intimate decor. And in the back they have a fantastic view of Pike's Place waterfront.
They have a great selection of items on their menu that are both exquisite and delicious. My GF and I ordered the Pink Door Lasagna, Special squid ink pasta with mussels and shrimp, Arancini and Tuscan Fries to share. The TUSCAN FRIES WERE AMAZING! They fry it with sage, rosemary, and garlic which gives it a subtle yet addicting flavor. The Arancini was quite good, but I was truly impressed by the Lasagna. Although it comes in a small dish, this is really all you need. Layers of spinach pasta packed with rich bechamel sauce and pesto and marinara was to die for. This is certainly one of those dishes you eat slowly to just savor all of the flavors.
This is definitely a must try for those who love Italian food or just want to spend a romantic night out with someone special. Just make sure to reserve a table early in advance."
The Pink Door,Daisy V.,"Known for its pink door entrance, The Pink Door was something I was excited to try in Seattle.
Wow, the view and ambiance were amazing here. I recommend reserving an outdoor table if you can! The view is so nice and there's something about eating outside here during the day that makes you feel good.
The lasagna was delicious. I kept raving about it while eating! The service was great. The Pink Door is a charming place to stop by for lunch or dinner if in Seattle."
The Pink Door,Tamara D.,"We've been looking forward to coming here for weeks. I'm so glad we made reservations because when we got there 5 mins before opening, there was already a group of people waiting. By the time we were seated, the place was almost filled up.
I'd remarked on our reservation that we were celebrating our anniversary (15 years!!) and when we sat down the server brought out complimentary glasses of Prosecco for toasting. What a special touch!
We ordered several things I can't pronounce but this has to be one of the top tasting meals I've had. I always tell everyone about Mesa Grill in Vegas as the place I've had my best meal ever but this definitely rivals it. Such friendly staff, such great service, we will be back every time we are in town for sure."
The Pink Door,Sebastian T.,"This place not only has a great rep, but it can also back it up! I've come here a few times and I've always had great experiences. It is a pretty big space with lots of interesting features: aerial shows in the main dining room, live music, an amazing patio and inner section of the restaurant with gorgeous views of the water. This spot is really popular so I'd highly recommend reservations or you're easily looking at a 60 min+ wait.
While entrees here can cost $20-30 each, its nice to see that it's not fine dining to the extent where its tiny portions, but you get a nice hefty plate with great preparation. While the food I've had is good, it wasn't shockingly amazing. A solid 4/5 but you're really coming here for the overall ambience. I'd highly recommend coming here at least once to check it out! This place also is an amazing date spot!"
The Pink Door,Maggie S.,"Probably my favorite restaurant in Seattle...Pink Door never disappoints. I really appreciate the consistency of the quality of food and service! The perfect restaurant for casual dining with family or friends, and a romantic date night!
Winter Risotto | Must. Order. Creamy butternut squash risotto that warms up your entire heart...
Linguine Alle Vongole | The signature dish of pink door! This pasta dish never goes wrong; the white wine broth really elevates and balances out the flavor of the clam. Love this simple yet delicate dish!
Cioppino | Never a big fan of tomato broths but this one's different. The amount of seafood is worth the price and the tomato broth is light and smooth, so you won't get tired of it!
Northwest Fish of the Day | Not a must order, but good quality fish! The salmon is seared to perfection with a crispy layer of fatty skin and tender meat on the inside!
Tuscan Fries with Fried Herbs | The aioli is so tasty that we can't stop snacking on these fries!! Wish the flavors of the herbs are stronger..."
The Pink Door,Subail S.,"Love this restaurant, little bit pricey, but never disappoints.
You definitely need to reserve table if you want to sit in the main dining. My advice will be a week before to be on the safer side.
Went for dinner on our first anniversary. Didn't reserve the table early, so got the slot at 10:15 pm. :( but got the table with the best view.
Food is always good. They have one of the best oysters in the city. So highly recommended. Other foods are also good.
Only sad thing is they don't have lot of optIons for the people who are allergic to red meat and shrimp. So that was a bummer for my wife.
But still would like to go back again."
The Pink Door,Cindy C.,"It's hard to get a reservation for this place as it gets booked months and months in advance. Imagine my surprise and happiness when we snatched up an available lunch time that worked for a party of 2! We were also visiting from out of town, so really happy that it all worked out.
You can also be on standby and wait for a table, but it can be a long wait.
FOOD
We ordered the rabbit ragu pasta and cioppino soup.
The rabbit ragu pasta was better than I expected. The meat was tender, and the pasta had texture.
Cioppino soup was delicious! Exceeded my expectations a lot. There were plentiful pieces of seafood. I would recommend dipping the complimentary bread with the soup. I was full after the dish.
SERVICE
The servers were very attentive with refilling our water.
PARKING
It's in the heart of pike place where post ally is. If you are driving, there are parking available nearby."
The Pink Door,Elizabeth L.,"One of our go-to date spots, love Pink Door! Favorite seats are at the bar - fun bartenders, ample space to enjoy lovely live music and jazz while indulging in delicious house pastas.
Linguine Alle Vongole - obsessed with this dish. Baby clams in shell, pancetta, garlic, chilis in a light white wine sauce. Clams for days, linguine perfectly al dente.
Lasagna - an interesting house version with super thin sheets of spinach pasta, layered with bechamel and pesto, topped with marinara - flavorful artistry, no dull, heavy lasagna here.
Crab risotto - chockfull of crab! A beautiful risotto, albeit not as interesting as the linguine or lasagna
Service is friendly and professional - have always enjoyed excellent service at the bar. Reservations are recommended as waits can be formidable during peak hours, but if you come by on a whim, just put your name down and enjoy a drink at Radiator Whiskey, Rachel's Ginger Beer or any of the fun bars nearby!"
The Pink Door,Dean C.,"1/12/20
Not that I paid particular attention, but from memory it seemed like Pink Door has been all over my Yelp feed since forever--I think every foodie that lives in Seattle, or has been to Seattle, has Yelped this place. So, I had to...
But for those that aren't from Seattle, or I guess I should say for those from California cause I heard other states have similar, but it appears many restaurants, even the really popular ones are REALLY REALLY REALLY hard to find. Like I tried to get to this popular bar the next day and it was on the 2nd or 3rd floor with NO SIGNS outside the building. Really no way to know how to get there without being told...
and yeah, so Pink Door is one of those. First, it's in an alley. Luckily the GPS does hint at that. BUT, I spent the longest time trying to find the entrance cause there's NO SIGN outside, and THERE IS NO PINK DOOR (unless I'm color blind?) The door IS NOT PINK. So, if you see this plain door but hear some trance or other form of electronica, this is probably the place, so you can open the door.
Yeah, so trance... when I walked in, there was a girl hanging from the ceiling on a rope, dancing in the air like a ballerina, accompanied by some trance. So, it's a mostly-traditional Italian restaurant food-wise, with an extremely modern vibe. Interesting.
Food though is above average but not particularly great...
1. Pink Door Mocktail (Non-Alcoholic) $8 ""bartenders seasonal creation"": Don't. Unless you wanna pay $8 for a lemonade. Mocktail my ass. 1/10
2. Cup of Riobolita $10 ""the traditional Tuscan vegetable & bread soup w/ cannellini beans and parmigiano reggiano, a wooden spoon should be able to stand up in the pot"": I did try to stand a spoon in it... and waddya know, it fell but got pretty close. I think if it were a normal sized spoon it might have done it! Think of this soup as a vegetable stew, with just a little but of French onion topping. As for the ""bread soup"" part, I'm not sure where the bread went--maybe as a thickener? Anyway, it was okay, but not particularly special. 6/10
3. Cioppino Pink Door $27 ""prawns, rock fish, mussels, clams and clamari in a spicy tomato and white wine broth"": Compared to others I've had, the soup here is pretty thin and super peppery, though I did enjoy the abundant seafood flavor. It's also served piping hot, which was nice compared to other restaurants. The mussels were tiny, but cooked absolutely perfectly with super plump flesh. The fish was just okay--not dry but definitely not moist. Shrimp was good and still crunchy, but not really what I'd expect of ""prawns""--they're just the same shelled, curled shrimp you see in standard Chinese food. Strangely, there was absolutely no carbs served??? No toast, no nothing. Weird huh? 6/10
4. Flourless Chocolate Cake $11 ""port wine, poached seckel pear, pomegranate port sauce"": Well, this is NOT a cake--but the waiter did warn me, so I guess I can't fault them too much for the false advertising. It's basically a chocolate bar of gaunache (fancy word for semi-soft chocolate) with a braised pear on top. I did like the tart sauce that was packed with berries, but otherwise there wasn't much to this dessert. But I suppose, if you're a true chocolate lover it might float your boat. 6/10
I am really tempted to give them brownie points for just being really cool, but honestly I wouldn't go back cause the food wasn't worth a second visit and I'm sure there are less fancy but better tasting Italian restaurants in Seattle, so...
(but I do think you should come here once sooner or later just to experience how weird and modern a ""traditional"" Italian restaurant can be while still being ""cool"" and without being annoying.)
Oooooooooooooooooh f it.... I guess it's worth a special visit just cuz... (but seriously, the food is just a 3)
4/5

The Pink Door,Jessica M.,"Came here for my birthday and I had the perfect experience. They had no more available reservations but accept walk-ins. We read from previous yelp reviews to expect a wait so we stopped by a little earlier to put our name and number down. We were told a 45 minute wait and our table was ready for us by the time we made our way back.
For starters, we ordered the Crostini Ai Funghi (mushroom on grilled toast). The mushrooms were flavorful and the toast was crispy! I love Linguine alle Vongole so this was a must. Definitely the highlight of the meal. Clams were fresh and the linguine was cooked to perfection.
Although the place was packed with people, our attentive server was able to bring out our meals quickly. This is a great restaurant for date night or hanging out with friends. Highly recommend - just try to make reservations beforehand."
The Pink Door,Jennifer K.,"This was probably one of my top favorite dining experiences in all of my travels. My husband's friend had mentioned this place, otherwise we would've had no idea and weren't planning on eating here. It's actually pretty hidden and you definitely need reservations, which I managed to get pretty last minute (visiting off season in January). The interior is very unique, it has an art deco/1920's vibe which I love. They actually have live trapeze artists on weekends, they perform above you while you eat. Unfortunately we missed that being a weeknight, but it was still a very entertaining evening. They had live jazz performers, and the atmosphere is just so lively. It has a beautiful view of the water if you're lucky to sit in the back area.
The food was delicious! We had Lasagne with besciamella, pesto, & marinara *new york steak with twice baked potatoes *caesar salad with crab and *maple creme brulee."
The Pink Door,Katie Y.,"God, I just love this place. The first time I came here was for my 16th birthday (quite a few years ago.. yikes), and the last time I came here was over 10 years later. It's just as good, if not better, than I remember it.
We came here right when it opened on a weekend, put our name in and got seated maybe 30-45m later. I'd recommend making reservations in advance if you can. The restaurant is a little hard to find the first time, walk down Post Alley and literally look for an unmarked pink door. Inside, it's surprisingly big with high ceilings as you walk down and start to realize how eclectic and funky it is inside.
The hype is so real about this place. We ordered charcuterie (both meat and cheese boards) and both were fantastic. The pastas did not disappoint, the risotto basically tastes like butter.. but in pasta form, if you're into that (butter, that is). Honestly, everything I've ever tasted here has been nothing short of amazing. If this place weren't so hard to get to (in an alley of Pike Place), hard to find parking, and hard to get reservations/a table, I probably wouldn't wait so many years between visits."
The Pink Door,Douglas R.,"The Pink Door is straight fire.
Background: In Seattle for a weekend getaway with my wife this place came on my radar. We had wanted to eat here on previous trips but didn't make it. I knew this place must be the real deal because we couldn't even get a reservation for the Sunday of MLK weekend. Surrounding days only had reservations for like 9 oclock or later. Reminds me of The House of Prime Rib in San Francisco in terms of difficulty of getting a reservation.
The Wait with No reservations: We showed up at 8 and were seated by 9:15 at a great table in the lounge. While we were waiting we scored a couple of seats at the bar and had drinks. Time went by fast as we enjoyed our drinks. Bartenders were super friendly and accommodating. My wife can't have gluten and they were awesome about making her a lemon drop with a grain free vodka.
Ambiance: One of the coolest most unique places I've ever been. Great live entertainment, dim lighting perfect for a date night.
What we ordered: Drink wise we went with a lemon drop and an old fashioned (2). Great drinks.
Winter Risotto: My wife ordered this and really enjoyed it. It comes gluten free too which she was super excited about.
Lasagna: Man this was a straight smoke show. Damn it was delicious. Mind blown.
Mixed Greens: Solid standard with a vinaigrette dressing.
Service:Great all the way around.
Bread:Complimentary bread before the meal. So nice that they had gluten free bread for us.
Prices: I felt like they were super reasonable for the quality of food and experience you get here.
Final Thoughts: Such a great night out. Thanks Pink Door. If you can't get a reservation don't let that stop you. Show up about an hour before you would have made your reservation time and just grab a bar stool. Have a drink and take it all in."
The Pink Door,Lisa E.,"There is a reason The Pink Door has so many great reviews, it is pretty fabulous. Is it a bit touristy and right near the fish market? Yes...but it is not just a cliche tourist joint. The Pink Door has great food and atmosphere! I have never had a bad thing here.
If you like oysters, get their oysters. They are delicious, and I love their peppery vinaigrette mixture that comes with it and the presentation is lovely.
I have had their seafood specials, pasta specials and just salads here and have never been disappointed. My customer once had a risotto here that she said was a bit bland, but other than that I cannot think of any complaints.
The bar makes fabulous drinks, and they have a great variety of unique liquors. The entertainment is what I believe the Pink Door is known for, and the hostesses do a great job trying to accommodate all patrons trying to see the stage. The atmosphere is grand and a bit over the top as you would expect. In general this is great for a cozy date, or even a lively business dinner. All clients and colleagues I have brought to the Pink Door have not been disappointed."
The Pink Door,Tazeen L.,"Great spot with a fun atmosphere, great views, occasional music and good food... came in without a reservation and had a 1.5 hr wait for a table for 3 on a Saturday night. Service was friendly and helpful, ended up sharing a few things:
-lasagna- recommended by waiter and definitely the winner - great balance of ingredients, well seasoned, everything you want out of cheesy comforting plate of pasta
- cioppino- seafood was fresh & tender, could have had more variety (mainly mussels and shrimp). Broth was light, could have used more seasoning
- pappardelle- noodles were al dente, ragu was good
Overall good spot if you can get a reservation..."
The Pink Door,Ce O.,"Came for our last supper in Seattle. We had Spiced Wine and The Butler to drink. To eat, I had the pappardelle bolognese. My partner had the lasagna. Both dishes were delicious but we could have used several more bites of each. I imagine that they don't make the main entrees larger so that you'll buy dessert. However, we don't eat sweets so we left feeling unfulfilled. The entertainment was a delightful added bonus, though. To get the full enjoyment of the experience, I'd recommend requesting cornered seating, so that half the party's backs aren't to the performer. Otherwise, give it try!"
The Pink Door,Stephen C.,"Arguably the most famous Italian restaurant in Seattle. After visiting I can understand why it sometimes can take months to get a reservation at this establishment. The Italian cuisine is on point and the service is impeccable. The restaurant seating is split between a lounge type of seating and a main dining room. We we were unable to get seating within the main dining room and sat in the lounge seating - personally we enjoyed it very much and it was very fitting for lunch. I would not let the unavailability of main dining room deter you from visiting the restaurant.
For drinks, we opted for the freshly squeezed mimosas. It was very well prepared. For appetizers, we ordered a side salad, which was amazing, the perfect amount of dressing and the presentation was great. We also ordered a dozen of the few oysters. As expected the oysters were very fresh and the accompanying mignonette sauce was perfect.
For the main entrees, we opted for probably the most popular dish on the menu, the clam pasta (linguine alle vongole) and also an order of the bolognese pasta. Hands down maybe the best bolognese I have had outside Italy. The clam pasta was also superb, loaded with fresh clams, and with the perfect amount of wine sauce. On a side note, we really appreciated how the restaurant made special arrangements to prepare a children's portion of the bolognese and they were able to plate it earlier than the rest of the meal.
Finished the meal off with an spritz, which would highly recommend for a brunch.
Overall, very pleased with the dining experience at Pink Door. It is no wonder why this restaurant continue to top the list of most popular restaurants in Seattle."
The Pink Door,Natalie K.,"This is a great Italian spot in Post Alley, it's a little hidden with the Pink Door... come early cause wait time usually is anywhere to 1-2 hours. And reservations are booked 60 days in advanced. You might get lucky and snag a seat at the bar
It's a cozy restaurant with dim lighting. Every night they do have live music/ entertainment.
We had a great server, he notified us that the menu changes every week/ holiday season so the pictures that you see you may not be able to order on the menu
To drink we started with Hennessy Sidecars ... can never go wrong
The Pink lasagna... sensational it didn't have meat but the sauce was impeccable and something like you probably have never tried before
The scallops were perfectly seared and crushed with potatoes and a sautéed spinach
The next dish was a Bellachini with Italian sausage... it was a little dry but still yummy with a cheese bite to it.
For desert we had a gelato tri and a chocolate cake with a chocolate coated pear... very rich but nice way to finish dinner off"
The Pink Door,Clarissa K.,"This place I had bookmarked by recommendations from my fellow Yelp friends. I should have prepared better as it was truly hard to find located near Pike Place Market on a path that was a back alley. I did not realize that the door is truly a pale pink and in the dark the only way you will know you arrived. But it added to this great find and mysterious local and surroundings. Once inside you feel like you are in London in a hidden location in a basement.
So the wait for a table would be an eternity especially on a Wednesday cold dank evening in November. Luckily there was two seats at the bar so that is where we had our dinner. The menu was unbelievable like reading a poem each one you wanted to try. We sat next to all the regulars they seemed so happy. Great place it truly is one of a kind. We started with a anchovy dip with raw veggies. It was interesting as well as delicious. The main course I shared with my colleague any menu loses me when I see pappardelle noodles with Ragu a la Bolognese sauce. OMG to die for! We had a nice wine to compliment the meal as well as made it warmer before entering the cold Seattle night air. Grand Marnier Panna Cotta with fresh figs for a sweet ending
Will definitely return on my next visit to Seattle."
Brunello Ristorante,Kathryn C.,"I had the most wonderful experience at this restaurant!
Tim, the owner, had an excellent wine special by the glass that paired perfectly with my starter of meatballs in a hearty marinara sauce. The meatballs were so delectable!
I appreciated the option of more Parmesan, fresh cracked pepper and red chili flakes throughout my meal as I like things a little spicy.
For the next course I had the Pomodoro Caprese and the tomatoes tasted so very fresh! The mozzarella, olive oil, balsamic and basil were top quality which all together made this delicious!
For my main course I had the Carbonara and if you are a fan of this creamy pasta dish with egg and panceta it does not disappoint.
To finish off my meal I had the in house made tiramisu and some limoncello. It was the perfect ending to a perfect meal.
Tim and his staff have definitely got the right vibe in this Ristorante Italiano with great conversation, fantastic wine and food and a comforting overall ambience. I will be back!"
Brunello Ristorante,Jenny Z.,"WOW the food here is amazing! Ate the leftovers for lunch today and honestly just as good. We came here for my husband's birthday dinner. I booked through Yelp for the first time and it was quite convenient.
We came on a busy Saturday night for an 8 pm reservation. Even though we came about 10 min early, we got sat right away. We started with a bottle called Marchesi which is a sangio/cab blend (mostly sangio) which was light with main note of cherry. I did wish it had more cab since we like fuller body wines, but the lightness ended up pairing well with our meal.
For apps we ordered the olives, caprese salad and caesar salad. Olives came out hot which I had never had before! It was flavorful and tasted amazing with their bread. The caprese salad was a generous portion and fresh tasting. Caesar was good as well. I added anchovies which were extremely salty...almost cured? I would pass on that next time, especially if you're expecting fresh anchovies like I was.
For dinner I ordered the seafood special. Husband ordered the gnocchi gorgonzola with chicken (after reading the review that the person could die happy after eating it lol). Both were amazing. I personally liked the seafood dish more. Very fresh seafood and perfectly al dente pasta. The gnocchi dish was rich and creamy and the chicken was tossed on top, which cut the creaminess in a good way.
Overall food tasted delicious and authentically Italian and will definitely be back to try more pasta. Next time we will definitely try the carbonara which had raving reviews. I also enjoyed the wine list which offered wines from several Italian regions. It's always nice to try a bottle you can't normally order from a Seattle restaurant. The ambiance was really nice and felt like you were transported to a little Italian restaurant in Trastevere.
The downside for us was the lackluster service, especially for a birthday dinner. Friendly server but forgot several things (forgetting to put in our appetizer order, asking several times whose birthday it was despite me writing it into the notes of the reservation and telling him, asking me to remind about the bday dessert, giving us another table's filled out receipt instead of my card back, etc.)
Just a little bit more thoughtfulness would have made the birthday dinner less chaotic-seeming. Good thing husband does not care all that much about bdays :) All in all a very nice dinner despite the unconventional service lol."
Brunello Ristorante,Elly S.,"I really want to like this place. It's very convenient with a warm atmosphere, friendly staff and a variety of tasty food options. Both times I've been, the food has been slow to come out but this isn't usually more than a nuisance, especially on busy nights. However, on Saturday night my husband's order was lost/forgotten, and he ended up waiting about 15 minutes longer for his food - a large seafood pasta dish. They were very kind about the mistake and even comped a couple desserts. In hindsight, though, I worry that the staff rushed to make the food in order to address the error, since my husband has had symptoms of food poisoning since the morning after, and undercooked seafood seems a very likely culprit.
Again, I want to like this place, but I don't think we will go back. For those who do go, I recommend the tiramisu and would steer clear of any shellfish."
Brunello Ristorante,Monica K.,"We celebrated our friend's birthday here for dinner last weekend. The restaurant was able to accommodate our large group fairly well.
I enjoyed the burrata appetizer - it was my first time trying burrata, and I thought it was good (though I have nothing to compare it with). I ordered the pasta special of the night, and got to try a little bite of my friends' pasta dishes. For all the pasta dishes I tried, I think they were good but not particularly amazing.
What stood out for me the most was Tim, who served us that night. He was extremely energetic, joyful, quick, and funny. He handled our large group with grace. I really appreciated the extra effort he put into giving us a positive experience!"
Brunello Ristorante,Mike N.,"Led to Brunello by the 4 1/2 star rating. While I was expecting an old style neighborhood Italian restaurant, I was underwhelmed when I walked in. It was a bit more ""rustic"" than I anticipated. Menu was mostly pastas but also had chicken and veal entrees. But this was ideal for the evening as I was looking for pasta along with the Huskies I was feeding. I ordered the only homemade pasta on the menu, the gnocchi with red sauce and meatballs. The gnocchi pillows were really good. However the sauce was way too spicy to my liking and I like heat but in this case it took away from the gnocchi. And the smallish meatbballs were bland. Service was excellent. You can expect a decent meal just don't come with expectations that you'll be blown away which a Yelp rating like it has will do."
Brunello Ristorante,Kristin B.,"April of this year when I went to Brunello. I had gnocchi with marinara sauce, which is one of my favorite dishes. It was delicious! I am all about sauce and this dish had it. The sauce was plentiful and tasty. The gnocchi was on point. If you're in the Roosevelt neighborhood, I would definitely make sure to give this Italian restaurant a try.
Accessibility: This place is accessible. There are no steps to get in nor any booths to worry about. It will be a tight squeeze when it is busy though. The flooring is raised tiles so it may be bumpy for any wheelchair users. I do not remember the washroom situation. I would inquire."
Brunello Ristorante,Jasmine S.,"Cozy atmosphere and authentic Italian flavors! A bit difficult to get the staff's attention as they were super packed that night, but overall a great experience."
Brunello Ristorante,Stacy S.,"Had a weekday dinner here, based on reviews from other Yelpers. We were not disappointed.
The menu had a great selection, and the food we ordered was tasty. I had a vegetarian pasta dish and he had a seafood pasta special. The portion size is very generous for the amount of each dish. The wine menu was decent and the service was very good. Our only complaint was that the vanilla gelato tasted more like ice cream than actual gelato, so that was a bit frustrating."
Brunello Ristorante,Mikala K.,"My husband loved his salmon pasta with lemon butter, capers and white wine sauce $29. I had the lasagna but lil too cheesy and very little meat or marinara sauce to relish on $14. The bread was actually bland but was improved by dipping it in balsamic vinegar and olio. Yet, if their entrees are this delish, then the bread should match the food quality. I highly recommend they try a better recipe or buy better tasting bread. I am a bread fanatic and unwarranted and unofficial bread connoisseur so if I dont like the bread, then the rest of the meal we be subpar automatically."
Brunello Ristorante,Paulina H.,"Food: 9/10 (Seafoods are fresh, not too spicy, everything taste perfect! But the pasta is a little salty.
Environment: 10/10 (great to sit outside when it's sunny and enjoy some wine)
Service: 10/10"
Brunello Ristorante,Joe M.,This place is awesome! I've driven past this place for a couple of years and decided to try it. Wow glad I did. The service was top notch and the food was even better. The drinks were great and the bread was to die for. If you want a treat go here. Blown away! Great job guys!
Brunello Ristorante,Elena G.,"It was a bit disappointing experience. After reading the reviews we decided to book the restaurant for my birthday when we arrived we were given the menus and were offered to taste some wine, which wasn't good. Then we ordered a more expensive bottle of wine from Brunneli's brand but the waiter decided to use the same glasses that he brought the wine to taste. When politely pointed to get us fresh glasses, his attitude was rather unpleasant. The food was very average. The lasagna was disappointing. The calamari were too chewy. The Fish stew was fine.
We see big fans of Italian cuisine. So really unfortunate experience."
Brunello Ristorante,Clarissa L.,"We came here as it was a short drive from our Airbnb.
Delicious food! Free street parking, friendly staff, quiet atmosphere, any pasta dish can be made as a half portion for children"
Brunello Ristorante,Brice B.,"A great, affordable Italian restaurant with a cozy, authentic dining area. It's very unassuming from the outside and location. The service is great as well."
Brunello Ristorante,Amy F.,"Hard five stars! We were here on a Friday night and the place was packed. The food was tasty, warm ambiance, easy parking. The server recommended a nice Barbaresco and recommended family-style dining, which worked out beautifully. Even though it was packed, they didn't hurry us out. I will return for sure."
Brunello Ristorante,Mayson L.,"I'm giving this place a 3.5/5 just by the food.
It's a small mom and pops kind of Italian restaurant which kind of makes you feel at home. The staff and waiters are super friendly and will make sure your water is never empty! Spectacular service. It was nice of them to offer all the dinner specials in a very well manner.
The food was just okay. I'm from Los Angeles and I was being too harsh comparing it to my favorite Italian restaurant back home. I got the spaghetti bolognese and fettuccini pesto. Both were a bit bland in my opinion. Meatballs were tasty though!
Overall, this is a nice date spot! They have plenty of wine options as well. Bye Seattle!"
Brunello Ristorante,Kerri K.,"It was our first time there and we will definitely return! Warm atmosphere, great food and friendly staff. Last night they had lobster spaghetti as a special dish(with saffron)--yum!"
Brunello Ristorante,non o.,"It's been a while since we ate here, so we came to try again. WOW! I noticed that last time I gave 4 stars but now I want to change to 5 stars! Everything we ate were delicious and we cleaned all the plates! We had meatballs, salad, bolognese (so creamy and great), I had squid spaghetti which was also great, and chicken marsala which was fantastic! Writing this review makes me hungry... definitely go back there again soon!"
Brunello Ristorante,Felisa D.,"I had been at the restaurant that used to be in this location. It was also Italian. That was as much as I can remember about it. Other than that, I don't quite remember how the food or service was.
My husband and I had an impromptu date night. We wanted to go to the Crest, but we wanted to eat out before the movie. I suggested this place because I had a hankering for pasta.
I tend to expect neighborhood joints to be good at best. And that's sometimes okay if you're, like us, hungry and desperate.
Look, I'm not saying this like being in Italy. But the food was pretty good. I generally don't love Italian-American cuisine because it tends to be too cheesy. This place served food that was between Jersey Italian-American and artisanal regional Italian cuisine if that makes sense. Like they at least have the decency not to batter and fry their calamari... But they do have your heavy sauces if you want your pasta that way. We enjoyed our pasta dishes and the service was very warm. It's not the cheapest meal but was quite reasonable everything considered.
For specifics: I'm not sure how I feel about the bread. It's served warm (which was fantastic!) but I just wish it has a little bit more crust and bite. The pasta we had was al dente and the sauces had a pretty good balance. I ordered the penne vodka while my husband ordered the linguini vongole. The penne vodka was good but was missing... Something. I asked for a side of parsley and was given some chiffonade basil lol that actually worked! It just needed a little brightness to balance the heavy creaminess of it. My husband enjoyed his dish but said it was also missing something. It was just a little bit of sauce.
Overall, we would come back."
Brunello Ristorante,Derek F.,"This place has become a fast favorite of mine! The service is absolutely amazing, the owner is super charismatic and takes the time to actually get to know his customers making the experience something else. The food is fantastic to boot! I especially love their homemade Gnocchi Gorgonzola."
Cascina Spinasse,Joey J.,"Worth the hype. Great mix of flavors on all the dishes. The pasta was my favorite, but the sleeper may be the onions stuffed with sausage. Those were unreal and were generally eaten in one bite.
Cocktail list wasn't too expansive but they had something for everyone. Wine list is extensive and the atmosphere is pretty intimate. We had 5 pm reservations on a Tuesday and the place was packed by the time we left around 7.
Beef cheek was fork tender and dissolves in your mouth."
Cascina Spinasse,Trang L.,"This restaurant is a must try if you are in Seattle! The hand-cut egg noodles tasted so fresh and perfectly al dente. The pork and beef ragu on top of the egg noodles were good, but a little bland for my taste. I've never had a cabbage salad that tasted so good. The prosciutto and egg added great texture and blended well with the crunchy cabbage. I'm not sure what kind of dressing was used, but it was delicious. The trout was crispy and full if flavor. Finally, the prawn risotto was amazing and a must try! I was so full and didn't have room for dessert.
Restaurant is small and intimate. Service is great!
I would rate this restaurant a 4.5 if I could and would come back again."
Cascina Spinasse,Stephen K.,"Summary: If you solely come here for a specific pasta dish, you will leave satisfied. But everything else is as unmemorable as it gets- from the service to the house bread to the dessert to the $30 trout (more on this later).
Elon Musk. Stephen Curry. Bill Gates. The Backstreet Boys. What do these transcendent cultural icons all have in common you ask? They went against the grain. Against popular belief. And that is what I must do in saying, aside from one pasta dish, Spinasse is an average restaurant. To say I was hyped to have snagged a reservation on a weeks notice in one of the hardest restaurants to book in the city would be an understatement. And ya know, maybe the high expectations I came with me doomed my experience from the start so I'll take some culpability in the an overall experience that was just really average.
Nestled on the outskirts of Cap Hill, Spinasse exudes a romantic, intimate vibe from the moment you walk in. So at this point I'm thinking okay, this is my last meal with my significant other before they leave Seattle, and we gonna go out with a bang! Spinasse said nah, check yo self.
SIDE NOTE: It's a huge pet peeve of mine when restaurants try and make their menu a version of Webster's Dictionary Word of the Day that us peasants can't understand. Degustanzione, braciola, guancia, tajarin, barbabietole, who knows what these mean! Smh. But I suppose the Italian adds a flare to the authenticity and I'm probably just being dramatic since at least there are descriptions.
We ordered:
1. Tajarin con burro salvia (4/5 Stars) $15 small portion: The ICONIC hand cut egg pasta with butter and sage was light and flavorful. And it also tasted exactly like the Butter and Sage Gnocchi from Trader Joe's. The dish could have perhaps used a little bit more kick, but nonetheless I enjoyed it and marveled at the texture of such finely cut thin noodles. I've never quite eaten a noodle like that, and this brother has had a lot of noodles believe me.
2. Tajarin al ragu (5/5 Stars) $28 large portion: This dish was exemplary. The pork and beef ragu perfectly complimented the egg pasta, and even tasted a little sweet. And honestly, for all my asian noodle folks out there, the first thing I thought of was this meat tastes exactly like the mince pork of Rou Zhao Mian!!! Just Italian style. So that's probably why I loved it so much.
3. Agnolotti dal plin (3/5 Stars) $16 small portion: This is where the meal started going downhill. The agnolottis were absolutely tiny and filled with beef and pork. And while it didn't taste bad, the agnolottis were drowned in shaved cheese and left you feeling simply unsatisfied. I felt like I had to ration every one which was eaten in a half a bite because there were so few and each was so small. Granted we did get the small portion, but if you are looking to get the best bang for your buck, this ain't it.
4. Trota (2/5 Stars) $30: I almost fell out of my chair when this came out. Imagine a rectangle in your head, and and add a little fish tail to the end of it. That's exactly how the trout came out. I appreciated the fact that all the bones were plucked out, and the salsa of sage and golden raisins underneath was quite good- but the star of the dish is supposed to be the trout and it was so unmemorable. It had little to no flavor, and the presentation of a rectangle + tail left much to be desired. I was upset I didn't order another large of the tajarin al ragu with Trout money.
5. Torta al cioccolato (2/5 Stars) $11: The table beside us ordered this dish, and it looked SO APPETIZING. Plus I was desperate to salvage the meal and end it on a high note. And while the dark chocolate cake with buttercream wasn't bad, it wasn't good either. It tasted like a chocolate cake. It wasn't moist inside, but it was rock hard either. Nothing made me want to eat more, and I ate it out of the immigrant mentality of no food wasted upon which I was raised.
I would come back for the beef ragu, but that is it. I will also say our server again wasn't rude or bad, but she also didn't enhance the overall experience. She seemed a little disinterested and went through the motions, and did not provide genuine, heartfelt hospitality. Of course, we aren't entitled to amazing service by any means, but when a restaurant does have that amazing hospitality, it adds so much to the experience.
TIP: For $105/person, Spinasse has a deal where the table shares every single appetizer, pasta, and main entree dish on the menu (slightly smaller portions but still a good deal)."
Cascina Spinasse,Ellen C.,"Wow, their pastas are really really delicious. The noodles are really thin which really brings out the flavor. Based on the yelp reviews, we ordered 2 half order pastas (the ragu and the butter/sage), a kale dish, and the onion stuffed with meat. Everything was delicious and between the 2 of us, we were absolutely stuffed.
I loved that they offered reservations for a Saturday evening at 6:30PM. I also did make the reservation about 1 month in advance. Parking was really easy since it was an early dinner, and was able to find street parking right next to this restaurant."
Cascina Spinasse,Ivy L.,"My friend loves this place and was absolutely adamant that we do our annual girl's holiday dinner here this year - so much so that even though the restaurant was booked, she called and left a message and was able to secure a reservation for us weeks in advance. I wasn't going to argue, I love pastas and homemade pastas are the absolute best! We had reservations during the holidays for a table of 5, and everything was set up and ready for us when we arrived. Parking wasn't horribly bad since it was on the outskirts of Capitol Hill, not in the mist of all the bars/restaurants/busy areas. We were able to find decent street parking quickly on a Friday night at 8pm. The restaurant itself is small and can be easily missed cause we definitely walked right passed it and had to turn around and walk back! It is a tiny little entrance right next to Altura, if you pass Altura by a lot, turn around! The is a double door leading to the interior to block out the wind, which is a nice touch. The interior is rustic and lightening makes it look like a candlelit tavern. The only complaint I had was the chairs - they were so so uncomfortable, it actually took away from my dining experience cause of how sunken the woven seats were and how erect the back was - please get new chairs!
Our server was quick and super friendly. We ordered a round of drinks, the Aperol Spritz was light and refreshing. We ordered 1 appetizer, 3 pastas, a main, and 2 sides to share between 5 girls and I thought the portions were definitely small. We were an ok full, but definitely not stuffed and could have maybe used a bit more food. The large pasta dishes were indeed on the smaller side, especially for the price. With that said, the pastas were good. We ordered the Agnolotti Dal Plin - little small pillows of delicious goodness. The tiny pillows were stuffed with such a flavorful concoction of meats and cheeses, beef and pork filled Agnolotti with a Double Brodo and Marjoram goodness to be excact. They were a burst of flavorful and the pasta was perfection (5/5). We also ordered the Tajarin con Burro e Salvia - basically a butter and sage pasta. Super simple but so much flavor. The tajarin pasta is Cascina Spinasse's signature dish - the super thin pasta is rare in most restaurants and Spinasse does it well. Lovely flavors of butter and sage, definitely the perfect ratio (5/5). And lastly, for the pastas, we ordered the Tajarin al Ragu. Again, an amazing ragu sauce with the right amount of cheese and the thin tajarin that just lets the sauce speak for itself. Delicious, albeit slightly on the salty side, just slightly. (5/5). My favorite dishes were indeed the pastas here - we also had two sides of kale and brussel sprouts - nothing to rave about there but a bit of greens to add to our carbo loading! The server recommended the Cipollini Ripiene - Roasted Cipollini Onions Stuffed with Beef and Pork Sausage with Toasted Pine Nuts and a side of bread as an appetizer and it was delicious! We had a friend who doesn't like onions but the mixture was cooked so well, you can't even taste the onions cause of the stuffed sausage. A good spread for the bread service (5/5). I also loved the amuse bouche, complimentary of the chef, the butter and anchovies toast was the most delicious mix and I would never think to serve butter with anchovies on top. Yum yum yum! I wish we could've ordered this dish alone. And our last dish was the special of the night, Pork Belly with Potatoes. The pork belly was tender and flavored well, though it wasn't my favorite dish of the night. The restaurant definitely stands out cause of the pastas!
Overall, good experience and lots of delicious dishes. Pastas, amuse bouche and appetizers were all fantastic. The sides and pork belly fell a little short, though definitely not bad by any means. For dessert we had the tiramisu and the panna cotta - by far the best panna cotta we've had in a long time. The tiramisu was in a small jar and was just ok - I think the panna cotta just stole the show! Service was good, ambiance homey, but chairs need to be replaced for comfort!"
Cascina Spinasse,Jun Li Z.,"Came here solo as I had always wanted to try this place out - it was in December. Sat at the bar and the waiters and waitresses alike were all friendly. There was one waiter - I forgot his name but he was super nice!
Service: Terrific and professional - almost fine dining-like.
Food: Ordered the appetizer - squash with bacon and nuts on it; thought I'd needed this one because I assumed the pasta wouldn't be enough. It was yummy but I actually didn't like squash as much. Ordered the beef ragu pasta and OMG it was toooooo good! I would order this again and again. I heard the butter and sage was also delicious!
Pricing: Be prepared to spend a bit more than your usual fare for dinner or lunch. This place is pricey - their service and quality of food makes up for it as they should if they are going to charge that much.
View from the Bar: If you are on a date or just traveling solo - I recommend sitting by the bar. I really enjoyed watching the workers make the pasta live! It was so fun to watch! You get to see them cut the noodles and slice and dice it. They seemed like perfectionist and made sure all of them were equal in size!"
Cascina Spinasse,Sheryl K.,"I want to start by saying that this is my most favorite Italian restaurant in Seattle. I've tried many pasta places in the city, but Cascina Spinasse is my go-to. I even designated this spot to be my birthday dinner restaurant!
I am absolutely obsessed with their butter sage pasta. I don't know what it is about this dish, but it's so delicious. I could literally eat this every day.
I've had several dishes that I thoroughly enjoyed, but the butter sage pasta is what always stands out and what keeps me coming back. I don't think I've had anything that I didn't enjoy here. They also have amazing desserts. The last dessert I had was their tiramisu. I'm not a huge tiramisu fan, but I enjoyed theirs. It was so flavorful and delicious.
The only thing that bums me out about this place is that it's so popular and sometimes challenging to get a reservation in. Sometimes we go as early as possible to see if we can get bar seating. It's usually a hit or miss, but if they can fit us in, I'm generally down to wait for them to clear up some space.
If you're into delicious, freshly made pasta like me, you need to come here! But I highly recommend calling ahead to see if you can get a reservation. Otherwise, try getting there really early when they open for dinner to see if they can fit you in."
Cascina Spinasse,I L.,"Everything was good.
Would order again by deliciousness:
Agnolotti
Onion stuffed sausage
pasta tajarin el ragu
The egg with cheese fondue was a bit too heavy for us. We ordered tajarin butter and sage a few years back - it was way too salty. Not sure if it was just an off night.
Service was exceptional."
Cascina Spinasse,Jennifer O.,"I made a reservation for Spinasse four months ago and due to conflicts that kept coming up, I had to bump the reservation twice. I was so excited to come here with my hubby for date night last night and must say kudos all around.
Food: we usually splurge when it comes to date night and spared no expense at Spinasse. We ordered two small pastas, two entrees, a side of veggies and two desserts. We ordered the butter sage tajarin and the the agnolotti. The portions were definitely small which was perfect for shareable dishes. The tajarin was rich and buttery and kind of had this melt in your mouth aspect to it. It was good but i would likely get the version with meat my next time around. I'm a gal who likes meat. Then came out entrees. Hubby got the beef cheek dish and I got the trout. I was dumbfounded when what looked like an entire fish arrived in front of me - skin , tail and all! I was expecting a filet and that was def not what I got. It honestly didn't look appetizing at all but was well seasoned and damn delicious when I got into it. Hubby loved his dish as well. I liked how the flavors of both of our dishes were complex but yet light at the same time of that makes any sense. It was a sophisticated delight to eat. We had sautéed kale with our meal and while it was good, it was honestly a little too salty. Then came dessert. Hubby got the apple tart and I got tiramisu. Both were BOMB. The tiramisu was rich and creamy, so good. Highly recommend both! We left extremely satisfied!
Service: the food at Spinasse is 4.75 stars but the service tips it to 5 easily. As mentioned, we had a reservation for 6:45pm on Friday night. We arrived at the restaurant at exactly 6:45p and was seated IMMEDIATELY. So many restaurants fall short of this gold standard unfortunately. In addition to be being seated promptly, we were also tended to frequently and the wait staff was extremely friendly and knowledgeable.
Atmosphere: small cozy classy restaurant but sans the 'tude. I can dig it. The restaurant is lively without being loud. Most patrons were on intimate dates and this is perfect spot for it.
Overall: excellent date night spot. Excellent food. Will return absolutely."
Cascina Spinasse,Rio D.,"Precaution: I'm very picky in general when it comes to food. I have very delicate pallet and I've traveled abroad a lot and gone to many restaurants. Especially when it comes to Italian, I tend to be a bit unfair because I'm used to Italian-Italian (lived there and visited many times.) So I should say maybe they are five but I just miss the authentic Italian. So four star. But everything else is good. Nice restaurant, service, menu, atmosphere, hip and trendy. Perfect for date night."
Cascina Spinasse,Alina H.,BEST DINNER EVER. Max was our waiter and was so knowledgeable and fun! He asked us lots of questions and helped us pick so many perfect courses. Service was insanely quick and some of the best Italian food I've ever had (outside of Italy)! Go go go go so worth it.
Cascina Spinasse,Michael P.,"One of the first Italian stops in Seattle: @spinasseseattle
Get a reservation because seats are definitely hard to come by! If I were to recommend anything, the pastas are phenomenal. STICK WITH THESE. You cannot go wrong. Be blessed. Both tajarins are staples of the restaurant and are the only pastas that do not get changed on the menu.
1. Antipasto misto della casa: uva con gorgonzola (fresh grapes with Gorgonzola piccante, hazelnuts, chicories, and parmigiana-filo crisps), vitello tonnato (poached veal loin with tuna maionese, parsley, and fried capers), insalata di peperoni (roasted peppers with chickpea purée, boiled egg, and anchovies), and prosciutto di Parma (pio tosino 14-month aged prosciutto with fresh melon)
2. Tajarin al ragù: fine hand-cut egg pasta with pork and beef ragù
3. Agnolotti dal plin: beef and pork filled agnolotti with double brodo and majoram
4. Pancetta ripiena: prosciutto-stuffed pork belly with roasted marble potatoes and rosemary
Tongue? Blessed."
Cascina Spinasse,Madeline C.,"Absolutely wonderful experience, including the food, service, and atmosphere. We made a reservation which was a good choice as our table was ready right when we arrived. I loved the warm, cozy Italian ambiance. We had the stuffed pearl onions (cipollini ripiene) as an appetizer which melted in our mouths with every bite. Then, we split the pasta dish tajarin al ragu, which was very rich and delicious, along with a side of the Zucca (I was skeptical of squash but it was very good and filling with yummy nuts and and Parmesan on top). Definitely a bit pricey but so wonderful for a special occasion or date night!"
Cascina Spinasse,Derek B.,"I had high expectations going into this, and I was not let down. I get nervous when I have to give a credit card in advance for a reservation, but I was dedicated and ready to commit. This place had been on my list for a while. OpenTable only had reservations very late in the evening, and when we called via phone (the horror!), they were able to accommodate seating us earlier, which was amazing because I was exhausted.
It has a dark ambiance. I don't know what rustic actually means, but maybe it was that? The table was ready and set up when we got there, so that was appreciated. The server was very cool. And that didn't prevent him from being very polite and providing excellent service throughout the meal.
The bruschetta was not what I typically think of when I think of bruschetta but it was amazing. The tajarin is one of their staple things, and I enjoyed that. The cavatelli with braised beef short rib ragu was definitely to the next level goodness. At this point in ordering food, I was nervous that I wouldn't be able to eat more, but somehow that wasn't an issue when the food came out and ordering the pancetta was not a mistake.
We ended the meal with this chocolate torta thing that was so balanced - it wasn't too heavy or overly chocolately. And the grappa pairing that they recommended was so on point.
I will definitely be coming back. I appreciate the great service, the recommended pairings worked really well, and all of the dishes that were ordered were consistently excellent."
Cascina Spinasse,Thao N.,"Finally got the pleasure to come here to try out their famous butter & sage pasta. One of those small, intimate settings with the dim lighting that I appreciate, but that means no photos for you guys;) The plates looked tiny, but is actually very filling so I recommend you getting a few of the half size pastas for more variety.
Going back to the butter & sage pasta, literally all my clients have been raving this so I've had it on my radar for a while now. I think they used actual angel hair because it was magical. It's one of those food porn moments, where it enters your mouth and might explode from all the bomb flavor.
Highly recommend coming here for any special occasion; birthdays, anniversaries, death of evil boss, or if you're a foodie like me and love exploring new places on a random Tuesday to avoid crowds, although this popular spot is busy all the time.
Tell me about your experience if you've been here or is going to after reading this review:)"
Cascina Spinasse,Spat S.,"Top food and service. Sat at the bar on a Friday night, great atmosphere and could see the pasta being freshly made in the kitchen. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable about all the dishes. Wines were amazing. Highly recommend the butter pasta staple, the ragu was also nice but didn't love it as much. Would definitely come back!"
Cascina Spinasse,Jennifer Y.,"Took an uber pool here - I suggest you do the same. Or walk? Seattle really isn't that stretched out the more you think about it.
Entrance is such a tease - what's behind those lovely white curtains? A magical place. Who knew that somewhere so cozy could exist on these cold rainy streets? There is one dining area (smaller) directly where you enter, then another (larger) adjacent to the left. The kitchen is visible through a glass windowpane where you can watch the pasta being made fresh and all the other happenings of the making of your food.
They're very friendly and understanding here. The moment you sit they ask you about any allergies or dietary restrictions. They're very clean - they clean every time they take away a plate. If you sit at the 'bar' - really it's just a nice view of the kitchen - they don't have hooks underneath the bar but they encourage you to hang coats on your seat or on their coat hanger hooks to the side.
Complimentary Crostinis
- Rabbit Liver Pate
Now I've never had pate so perhaps I'm just not cultured enough. But have you ever drank too much, then felt sick and thrown up? That after taste of thrown up alcohol is what this tasted like. I'm not trying to exaggerate or be overly rude, it's just exactly what this taste reminded me of.
- Butter and Anchovy
A lot of pepper. And a LOT of salt - tastes like extra salty fried fish. So, SO salty. Possibly too salty. But significantly better than the liver pate.
Tajarin con Burro e Salvia
Basically a very thinly sliced tagliatelle with butter and sage. This is a common combination but the first time I'd tried it. The sage didn't seem to mesh very well to me and the butter seemed almost like an aftertaste. The pasta however was undoubtedly fresh (not just because I'd seen them make it) but because it was so soft and rich. So soft it seemed like it should fall apart in your mouth but somehow still retained texture.
Carote Arrotiste
Huge, huge chunks of carrot. I wouldn't recommend getting this for one person because it could be a whole meal in and of itself. They were perfectly cooked but that's where the positives ended. Sweet then sour then various herb flavors - didn't seem like any of it meshed well together. The sour came through very, very strong."
Cascina Spinasse,Rosa K.,"I've been wanting to try out this place for so long and I finally got my chance! I came here on a Friday night (after 8pm) and I didn't make a reservation. I was hoping that since we got there around 8:30pm, we wouldn't have too long of a wait....they said the wait was 1.5 hours. SO DON'T FORGET- MAKE A RESERVATION! We weren't in a rush so we put our names down and go to the Italian restaurant next door to grab a drink and an appetizer (Artusi) while we waited (you can read my review for that separately :) )
We got the call around 9:45pm that our table was ready. We headed over there. I knew that I wanted to try the Tajarin but I couldn't decided if I wanted to go simple with the butter sage or the ragu. We decided to do BOTH. The pasta noodles were SO thin and just melted in my mouth.
Though the noodles were the same, the taste of the two dishes were so different. I did love the simplicity of the butter sage, but I felt that there was more flavor in the Tajarin al ragu (I love meat sauce). The butter sage had such a rich but delicate taste. The hint of sage elevated the pasta to feel elegant. The Tajarin al ragu is more of a homey taste. It has more ""umph"" from the tomatos and the meat which is right up my alley.
We got the smaller size of each of them and we were able to eat them both (even after our appetizer meal next door). The pasta noodles aren't as heavy and filling like ""normal"" pasta noodles which was a nice because I didn't feel as full or bloated.
The service was amazing, the waiter was so friendly- went through the menu, portion sizes and wine selection.
I definitely don't regret getting both the Tajarin dishes. I will definitely be back!"
Cascina Spinasse,Owlburt L.,"Went here last Saturday with the wife and our daughter for a belated birthday dinner. I had been excited and had high expectations based on the reviews. I booked this over a month ago and was hoping for a great experience.
Unfortunately we were both quite disappointed. The service was good but that is expected for a high end restaurant like this.
The food, however, was a major disappointment.
We started with the Uva Con Gorgonzola and the Cippollini Ripiene (both highly recommended by our waiter). The Uva Con Gorgonzola was an interesting dish most of which is I have never paid $15 for about 10 green and red grapes cut in half with 5 crumbled pieces of cheese and some hazelnuts. The balance just wasn't there for us. The grapes were sweet, the dressing has some zing to it and the cheese was just too salty. The Cippollini Ripiene wasn't too bad but it was again, overly salted.Unfortunately the ""overly salty"" theme was to be repeat itself to every dish we ordered afterwards.
And I am someone who usually puts extra salt on everything. Hell I even have slightly high blood pressure because of the amount of sodium I ingest.
We then ordered half orders the Tajarin al Ragu and Agnolotti dal plin and the Pancetta Ripiena. Although all the dishes were not badly made, the fact that all them were overly salty, ended up overpowering any ""complex"" flavoring that might have existed under it.
With drinks our bill came out to abut $180 plus gratuity. In the end was basically $100 per person (since our daughter didn't really eat anything), which is way overpriced for something that was nothing special and overly salty.
We won't be back and that's unfortunate since we really wanted to like this place. I am not a penny pincher when it come to eating out, I don't mind shelling out the money for good food, but why pay 4 times more for something you can get at places Il Nilo or Il Corvo that is much better."
Cascina Spinasse,Dan C.,"I was looking for a good place for an anniversary dinner, and just did a web search for good restaurants for special occasions in Seattle. Spinasse was maybe the third one that came up, but they had me at fresh made pasta. And oh my, the pasta...
But im skipping ahead. The restaurant itself is nondescript from the outside, sandwiched between a couple of other Capitol hill eateries. Inside is clean and close, with a rustic feel. Depending on where you sit, you can watch pasta being made in the kitchen... long sheets of beautiful, yellow, eggy pasta... I'm getting hungry again..
Service was prompt, friendly, and generally fantastic, with care given to cleaning the table between courses and being careful to not touch the silverware and plates as they were being replaced. We even got an extra candle and a couple of Happy Anniversaries! towards the end of our meal.
The food was even better. To start, we had a poached egg in cheese fondue and a savory shallot flan served over spinach and topped with fried shallots. Both were excellent, but I could eat that flan every day for a year.
Main courses were pasta in brown butter sage sauce, and prosciutto-stuffed pork belly. The pasta was, in a word, perfect. The stuffed pork belly was pork stuffed in more pork, with an herbed demi-glaze, and roasted potatoes. Awesome.
I finished up with an apple crostata, paired with an excellent grappa, and my Mrs. had the lemon curd and ricotta layered mousse.
I've had meals all over the world, and this was in my top 5 best meals so far. The ratings already reflect it, but this is a restaurant worth checking out more than once; we literally started planning our next meal there about halfway through this one."
Tavolàta,Tay W.,"Atmosphere: Dark and lively.
Service: Awesome! Our waiter gave great recommendations and checked in on us regularly.
Food: My fiancé got the rigatoni & I got the Pappardelle. Both dishes were amazing. If you like your pasta fully cooked, be sure to let your waiter know. Their pasta is cooked al dents--a bit firm. It didn't taste bad, but I wouldn't have mind if it was cooked a little bit more!"
Tavolàta,Natasha G.,"I've come to Tavolata twice now and while the overall experience is passable, my 3 star rating is bc nothing really blew me away. In my most recent visit, I came with a large party (14 people) for my friends birthday dinner. My first of three stars this place gets is for the service - we were able to create a customized tasting menu including appetizers, pasta, entrees, sides, AND dessert for the birthday, with a mix of veg and non-veg options to meet the needs of various people in our party. The waiters were friendly and attentive throughout, and I'll add another star for an ambiance that is good for special occasions with large groups to date vibes or intimate friend group dinners.
The food didn't wow me though - I've had much more memorable Italian in a 5 mile radius of this place. We started with a standard meat board (it's hard to mess that up), burrata that honestly was bland, and fried lard which tasted a bit rubbery and not fresh. The pastas (potato gnocchi and ravioli) were also just ok - the ravioli had a weird honey taste mixed with the savory sauce, and while some cuisines nail the mix of savory and sweet, I don't think Italian pasta is the right place to try it (at least this one). Finally, the pork chop was hard to bite, chew, and swallow - it honestly tasted like a dish you would get at a college dining hall. The farroto (off the menu veg item), as well as the rapini, however, were decent - the garlic/lemon zest on the rapini was a nice palette cleanse from the pasta and the farroto was a solid veg risotto. My third star is for those dishes. Finally, the lemon donut dessert was fine, but again, better donuts and dessert options within a 5 min walk from here (cue Salt & Straw, General Purpose, and Frankie & Joes).
If you do end up coming here for some reason, ask for the Farroto and rapini and it'll satisfy your taste buds while enjoying the vibrant ambiance. I wouldn't waste your calorie intake or $$ on anything else from here."
Tavolàta,Lisa C.,"My husband and I decided to go here for my birthday. I had heard so many good things about it and it was an Ethan Stowell restaurant after all.
It was very unimpressive. The buratta appetizer with lemon curd like topping was delicious. But it ended there. That should have been recommended as a dessert, not appetizer. The eat if the meal, pasta, was overpriced for what it tasted like and the amount.
The most odd thing which may sound great... But was awkward for me was we had three different servers take our appetizer order and hence we were confused what was really going to come and if we would get duplicates. It all worked out as we tried to be clear that another waiter had taken our order. But I found that burden and all the interruptions very uncomfortable.
Anyway, I was underwhelmed."
Tavolàta,Peter C.,"So so so much to like about Tavolata. Get the bread basket - it comes with this delicious spreadable cheese and balsamic vinegar. But the star is the spreadable cheese -it will blow your mind how flavorful it is. They didn't have any specials that night, so I played it safe with spaghetti & meatballs. But goodness gracious this is nothing like what you can make at home, and that's the whole fun of eating out. It's covered in a pile of parmesan with sturdy, firm noodles and it's SO good. Run, don't walk to this one. Slightly dim lighting so you might think it's a romantic date spot, but it's kind of loud on the inside, unless you're lucky enough to get a quiet corner somewhere. Anyway, just go and thank me later."
Tavolàta,Camille W.,"My friend and I were exploring Capitol Hill and happened upon Tavolata and we were both pleasantly surprised! It happened to be 15 min before happy hour ended and the barista took our orders in just in time. One thing I will say is I do not think I would be as happy paying full price for what we got, which is why it is 3.5 stars.
We ordered the arugula salad, bruschetta, spaghetti, and rosemary gimlets. The arugula salad was crisp, cheesy, and lemon-y exactly what you're looking when consuming a bitter salad. It was actually my favorite part of the meal ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ The spaghetti was a little too anchovy-y which I found odd since I was searching for the salt and pepper shakers... the meatballs were good but the flavor was lacking. The pasta appeared to be fresh pasta but was just a tad too al dente. My friend and I both agreed within our first bite that it should've had more time in the hot water, but the parm shavings were a nice touch. The bruschetta did not come had we not asked about it, which was fine with us since we were working on our other choices, but I had to ask for that. But it was sourdough bread with a very unique dip and a side of olive oil and balsamic.
Sitting at the bar made me realize how tricky it must be to multitask all the aspects of a full menu and drinks for the whole restaurant. The gal at the bar handled it like a champ. The rosemary gimlet was actually one of the most memorable! Refreshing, perfect amount of rosemary taste and citrus and relatively strong on the gin, which is an excellent balance. Our bill was $30 each with tip which I thought was still on the higher end for what we got.
All in all, I would perhaps try it again if I were coerced into it but I don't know if the pasta made that much of an impression to me to come back. I've had better pasta elsewhere, maybe I just didn't order the right thing?"
Tavolàta,Huong L.,"This was on my list of Seattle restaurant week and it did not disappoint at all.
We made reservations for 6 on Monday and got seated right away. I was interested in their happy hour menu as well and they were able to accommodate us for the bar area.
The menu was awesome for SRW - you get to choose an appetizer, entree and dessert on their regular menu!
- Brussels sprouts - filling, good texture, a little bland
-albacore with mussles - interesting, the albacore was thick cut and cooked medium rare. It was bland but went well with the mussles and sauce
-sorbetto - ice cream went well with the cookie, but wasn't sure where the sweet and salty came from as both was sweet. The ice cream was coconut lime and was good.
The HH menu was also awesome!
-bruschetta - fish was good and was a lot on the crunchy/soft bread. Flavor was spot on.
-parpadelle - favorite meat sauce, and the pasta was cooked perfectly
Price and portion for both menu was generous and I would definitely come back! Service was ok, not particularly amazing but better than what I expected. This is probably one of the best SRW restaurant Ive been to."
Tavolàta,Cindy V.,"Lovely environment. Romantic for dates and a great spot for happy hour - Pasta dishes running less than $15 that are filling! My favorite from the happy hour menu is the rigatoni with spicy sausage. Delicious, makes me want to get more every time. The gnocchi is also decent, no complaints.
The chicken ravioli is super bomb, I definitely recommend this dish (not on HH). At first I thought this dish was small but was filling even though I was super hungry.
Bruschetta with smoked fish - the fish is amazing! Tasted very fresh. I just wish the bread was a little softer. It was a little too crunchy to our liking but still a solid appetizer. I also tried the olive appetizer before but didn't really enjoy it.
I've only gone here for dinner and the wait for the food is pretty long. Service is okay nothing spectacular. I would suggest making reservation to avoid long lines for the weekend since it can get pretty busy or if you want to sit at the booth."
Tavolàta,Joey J.,"This place gets busy very, very fast. We were able to sneak into the bar area for some dinner. Cocktails were good, but the mai tai was very fruity. Espresso martinis were espresso forward.
The steak tartare was good, but almost too cold. I had the spaghetti with anchovy off the happy hour menu and it was the highlight. My wife had the tagliatelle with scallops, and she hated it. Scallops were diced up and the Alfredo type of sauce was off. It was honestly inedible but we were told it was a new add to the menu and delicious. It's also one of, if not the most expensive pasta on the menu.
I would go back for happy hour and just order off that menu. 4 stars without the tagliatelle factored in."
Tavolàta,Simone T.,"Well I am biased, because I met the love off my life at Tavolàta when my friend and I were at happy hour one evening. I love this place so much and am so grateful for it. The pasta and bread spread is always delicious and hopefully we will spend our anniversary here for years to come. If you happen to go for ddinner make sure to get some bubbly as well because they have a wonderful selection to pair with dinner."
Tavolàta,Ju C.,"Burrata: The cheese was just so fresh and well balanced with pear
Ricotta ravioli: The ravioli had the perfect amount of chew. The Sauce was nutty, zesty and sweet, perfect with ricotta cheese.
Pappardelle: This was one of the best pasta dishes I have ever had. The handmade pasta was so good and the ragu sauce was just a little spicy and minty so not greasy at all."
Tavolàta,Theresa L.,"Belltown as usual parking is horrible on a Saturday night. Luckily found a parking spot not far.
Booked a table a month in advanced. When we arrived we waited a little while but was seated fairly quickly. We sat at a shared communal table. Food came out hot and tasted great. Hand made in house pasta was perfect. The pork chop was so big, perfectly cooked. We enjoyed the pork chop over the beef.
We will go back again but must allow time to find parking."
Tavolàta,Siddhartha G.,"'Woohoo as good as it gets' is just about right for Tavoláta, I don't believe I've had better Italian cuisine in recent memory. My sample space though is only the bay area, but San Jose's Little Italy restaurants can hold their own.
The novelty factor at Tavoláta is high, beginning with super-spicy Calabrian spice roasted pistachios and ending with hazelnut chocolate topped with the bitterest grapefruit marmalade you'll ever have. Get it while you can, when I tried asking for the marmalade's source they told me it's only temporarily on the menu.
And of course, if the start and the end are so good, how could they falter on the middle course? Main entreé was a cheesy sumptuous semolina ravioli delight, the Gnocchi alla Romana.
It would be worth coming back to Seattle just to eat at Tavoláta again."
Tavolàta,Kristen K.,"My best friend in Seattle recommended this restaurant as his favorite Italian spot in the city, so we decided to make a reservation when a group of us were in the city.
It was a rainy Sunday evening and the restaurant was not too full when we came in for our reservation.
We each order our own dishes and I got to try some of my friend's dishes as well. Everything was very well plated and delicious (al dente)!!
Food:
Pappardelle - My friend and I split the Pappardelle and the spaghetti. I like the pappardelle more because it was a meat sauce and I haven't had an anchovy sauce before on my pasta. Both pastas were perfectly al dente and a pretty sizeable portion.
Anchovy Spaghetti with side meatballs - Meatballs were delicious! The spaghetti was a bit more fishy than I expected, but I liked the pasta overall. It was just more overpowering than I thought.
My friends all seemed very happy with their pasta dishes (also the salumi board was excellent). We all pretty much cleaned up all of the food somehow. I think the bucatini might have been a clear winner of the pastas though.
Overall, really delicious Italian restaurant in Capitol Hill. Very nice space and excellent service. Definitely would recommend coming here to try some delicious pastas!"
Tavolàta,Kevin Z.,"Pretty run of the mill Italian fare. We had a large table come in for a birthday dinner. We ordered the rigatoni, papparadelle, tagliatelle, spaghetti and meatballs, hanger steak, and porchetta. The pastas were ultimately forgettable as the flavors and textures were decent but nothing special. Visually, the porchetta was stunning but came to our table very cold and had to be reheated. The dish ended up being disappointing because it was fairly one dimensional favor wise.
Overall, service was great but food left much to be desired."
Tavolàta,Amy L.,"Went here after work with coworkers on a Thursday night, and was able to get reservations quickly.
The food was pretty fancy and delicious, but a little pricey. The servers/ staff were very nice and friendly.
I will definitely come for another try!"
Tavolàta,Sara C.,"Really great and authentic pasta without the wait! I can't say enough great things about this place. From service to food, every experience I've had has been wonderful. The restaurant is very accommodating of big groups, staff is knowledgeable and friendly, and careful with food allergies. The kitchen is on it! Food is fresh and delicious. Menu is fun and adventurous, and talk about that happy hour menu too.The atmosphere is trendy yet sophisticated.
Just go, you won't regret it, maybe make a reservation ahead of time. It's the little things, the attention to detail that add up into one great experience. I'm determined to try everything on their menu!"
Tavolàta,Cary H.,"Trendy Italian restaurant with friendly, accommodating staff and well-dressed diners. The happy hour crowd brightens the room and it quiets down after 7.
We ordered almost half the menu and ate family style. Ingredients were of high quality and very fresh. The preparation was disappointing. Some entrees were were bland, and others were over seasoned. The branzino was overcooked into a dry mess. Also pasta was inconsistent, varying from hard/al-dente to mushy soft. Only standout was the perfect lamb-mousse bruschetta.
Yelp pictures and trendy menu are deceiving. Happy hour prices for a quick bite/cocktail is probably fine. But for fine Italian dining, Tavolàta is just not there. I have high hopes they can work on consistent preparation as those guys in the kitchen seem like they are really trying."
Tavolàta,Ellen C.,"This place is always consistent in terms of food and service. Came back during Seattle Restaurant Week ($35 for 3 courses). Got an appetizer (salumi board), an entree (opted for the confit chicken instead of pasta since I always get pasta here), and dessert (panna cotta). Loved every single thing as usual!
I was also introduced to the Zeppole (lemon donuts with powdered sugar that you dip into a chocolate sauce) which was AMAZING. GAH. Next time I head to Tavolata I'm definitely ordering that for dessert."
Tavolàta,Robyn C.,"You can't go wrong with their happy hour. I've had the spaghetti and chicken meatballs as well as the gnocchi.
Fresh pasta that's perfectly aldente with light and flavorful meatballs and a rich red sauce. The portion is pretty big too. I believe it was under $15.
The gnocchi is not you typical baby pillows. These are fluffy euro pillows tucked in a cute baby casserole dish- blanketed with sauce. The gooey cheese helps too!"
Tavolàta,Carmen V.,"Great to remember Italian sounding restaurants you marked in your mental 'to try' list from a previous visit to Seattle. In this case, remembering the Tavolata name saved my night, as my colleague and I were literally fighting and almost grabbing each other's hair to go and have dinner together somewhere were we both could enjoy. My colleaguefriend is Indian and somehow picky with her food intake.
Myself, I am in ketosis mode and with bad mood for cutting bread from my diet plus all that sugar...therefore irritable. Tavolata saved our night. My colleaguefriend enjoyed her pasta (al dente, not hard! ) and I definitively went fully keto, with that halibut in romesco sauce and shared an octopus carpaccio mega delicious with her. Also, had an non alcoholic cocktail that was so good you forgot it has no alcohol in it.
Great quality food and very nice atmosphere. Looks like mostly customers were pretty girls in pairs (well, not talking for ourselves in this case) and some matc.com kind of couples just on a first date. Packed but fast and friendly service."
Il Corvo Pasta,Jessica L.,"This is my favorite pasta place in Seattle! I heard so many great things about it for a few years but finally tried it this past March. The pasta is fresh and the sauces are delicious. Even though the wait was super long (about 90 min)on a Friday in August, it was honestly worth the wait.
One of my favorites was the spicy sauce pasta with octopus. The menu changes daily so make sure to check out their Instagram page before you head there."
Il Corvo Pasta,Phillip N.,"Unique pastas everyday, high quality ingredients, delicious food!
Il Corvo deserves the hype it gets. I recommend checking their Instagram before you go to see what their daily pstas are, but if you're too lazy, their bolognese is always a solid go-to pasta. The pasta has a very nice bite to them and the meat is very savory and packs a heavy punch.
The line gets long but doesn't stay stagnant."
Il Corvo Pasta,Dione L.,"If you are trying to find the best pasta in Seattle. Its going to be right here. The line and preparing to wait in a lie isn't just the hype. The hype is seriously real. Please get the salad and focaccia if you're going to wait the whole time. I always get their bolognese because its just so good. I literally have dreams about the pasta and most importantly with sauce.
This place is truly unique because they post/ rotate their menu everyday and they only keep the bolognese. SOOOO GET THE BOLOGNESE.
Service is great and the resty is a VIBE."
Il Corvo Pasta,Jason L.,"I finally got around to dining here and I'm so glad I did! Since they're only open on the weekdays during lunch time, it makes dining here pretty inconvenient. Unless you work in the area or have the day off, coming out here might prove to be a little tough. If you do decide to come here, let me advise you to come at 10:30, 30 minutes before they open. You'd rather wait 30 minutes outside than possibly 1+ hours outside.
The menu rotates daily and they only have 3 pasta options. The day we went, they had pappardelle, orecchiette and torchiette. If you're unsure what type of pasta each one is, they have sample ones in front of the cash register so you can see. We decided to get one of each since it's such a pain to get out here. The portion sizes aren't too big since it's lunch time so I think two people can easily finish 3 orders. The pastas are delicious! They're all cooked perfectly al-dente and perfectly chewy. All three were amazing but I probably enjoyed the torchiette the best since it was the cheesiest of them all. Don't get me wrong though, they were all great!"
Il Corvo Pasta,Mia C.,"For the price, portion, and quality of the pasta, iL Corvo is solid. However, I would not wait in line for over an hour to come here vs others in the area like Pasta Castalinga or Due Cucina, where there is no line. The pesto pasta and signature parpardelle were both good, and I love the olive oil they use here. Their open hours are only suited for people who are able to come at 10:45am, and even then it would be a 45 min wait before being able to eat. Not convenient. Good pasta."
Il Corvo Pasta,Victoria C.,"I've been so excited to come to this place due to all the hype around it. I might have come on a slightly off day though.
We came the day after Christmas around 10:45 AM, 15 minutes before they open. And they aren't kidding when they say if you don't want to wait that long to come around 10:30 AM to get in line. The line was long. And it might have been because a lot of people were off the day after Christmas, so why not come to get some delicious pasta.
You order once you get to the front, and the cashier will tell you where to sit. Like everyone else says, they do have a good system. They bring out pasta to you pretty fast, you eat, bus your own tables, and just get moving. There always seemed to be an open seat right when you got to the register. My husband and I got all 3 of the pastas, an order of the housemade focaccia bread, the kale salad, the proscuitto, and one of the dulche de leche cookies. The bread was the best part of the meal, although I do wish it was a little warmer. But I understand that they're trying to get it out orders as fast as possible. The kale salad was fine, as we the proscuitto.
When the pasta finally came out, we weren't blown away. To us, the base of the pasta dishes kind of all tasted the same. I was hoping the bolognese would be a little more flavorful, but it was just okay. They do have take out boxes for you to grab on your own as well.
For the line and wait, I probably wouldn't come back here. We didn't find the wait worth it honestly. The parking around the area is pretty scarce as well. There are some lots where you pay $10 an hour. Otherwise street parking is going to take you a little while to find."
Il Corvo Pasta,Mandi W.,"I stupidly came here at lunchtime... Whyyyyyyyyyy?!?!?!
1 hr 9 minutes later, we're finally seated. That line is deceiving though. You have your outside line... But once you get to the front you realize there's an inside line lol. Whyyyyyy?!?!
Anyways, once you make it to the front of the inside line, you order, find your seat, and staff will bring your food out. Once finished, bus your own table and be on your way.
Their pasta menu changes daily except for the pappardelle. We got that and the campanelli. Both had great flavor, and noodles were fresh and cooked perfectly al dente.
They'll seat you at any open table so you'll most likely be joining another party. Obviously parties of two are easiest here and it seemed most common.
Tldr: good pasta, long lines, not sure if it's worth that wait. I'll try again at an off time. Stay tuned."
Il Corvo Pasta,Phil H.,"Absolutely loved the whole experience here.
We were in town for a few days to explore Seattle before our Alaskan cruise and wanted to hit up a spot for lunch where the locals eat. II Corvo was highly recommended.
As advertised, there is a wait and the line can be long. We got on it and patiently waited. Moved decently overall and we got in after a while.
You head up to the main counter and place your order. Staff is very friendly and will find you a spot to eat, even if there is a small wait until other diners finish up. It's not the biggest place and it was packed while we were there. Was told this is pretty much the norm. Even so, they found our group of five a table within minutes.
The delicious house made pasta arrives fairly quickly. You grab your own napkins, utensils, water, and clean up after yourself once you're done. Each day they feature different pastas. At only $10 a plate it's super affordable. We each ordered different pastas to taste and share. Loved it.
Oh snap that focaccia bread. It's pretty awesome. It's the crack of carbs. Dipping oil too. The kale salad blew my socks off. I hate kale, as do most of my group, but we fought over this bowl and devoured it.
One of the best lunch experiences we had while on vacation."
Il Corvo Pasta,Rebecca B.,"I was visiting family for the holidays and waited in line on Christmas Eve for 40 minutes starting at 10:20am before opening and have no regrets. There was a line to the corner block by 10:30. My little brother, an aspiring chef, made me watch the Eater episode featuring Il Corvo the night before, but it didn't take much convincing to wait in the cold with him in order to be one of the first customers in the door.
We ordered a feast of the kale salad, focaccia, pappardelle bolognese (the staple signature dish), pasticcio, and wine. The menu changes and Il Corvo announces daily what three pasta dishes will be served that day. Tip: check Instagram for updates. You can't go wrong whatever you order. The kale salad had a delightful crunch with a lemon dressing and generously sprinkled cheese. The house focaccia is unlike any focaccia I've ever had. There is no way to accurately describe the doughy, chewy, fluffy goodness. The quality and ingredients is unlike any other. The pasta itself was everything the reviews said it would be. Each pasta dish is reasonably priced at just over $10. I'm convinced I won't find pasta like this anywhere near me in Colorado and I'll be waiting in line again during my next visit.
My only regret about Il Corvo is that it is a quite small restaurant. Since word of its superior pasta has spread, there is a line that extends from the front register where you order and pay and wraps out onto the block. You will likely share a table (family style) in order for Il Corvo to serve more customers. I think this is actually a fun family-like environment but others may find it stifling as people bustle next to you waiting in line as you try to enjoy your food. Nevertheless, the pasta is worth it."
Il Corvo Pasta,Kathy M.,"Our first day in Seattle as we were wandering around, we passed a long line of people waiting outside this tiny Italian restaurant. The weather was not great, so of course, I had to ask someone what was going on and WAS THIS LONG LINE WORTH THE WAIT.....I was told with an emphatic YES that this place was definitely worth a line and was given a brief summary of what to expect if we chose to try it out. We saved it for our last day on the hopes that a Monday might not be as busy as a Friday. Turns out, that this place is just busy! We arrived at 10:30 and took our place in line and our party of 8 walked out of this fine establishment at 12:40. Overall, everyone agreed that it was definitely worth the wait!! Their daily menu items are listed on a blackboard that you have more than enough time to read while you wait in line to order. In fact, because you are standing in line for the register in the middle of the 2 rows of tables, you also have ample opportunity to check out what the dishes look like as they are brought out to the other customers. This staff is amazing!!! They are friendly, efficient and seem to love where they work. No matter how improbable it seems, by the time you order and are looking for a place to sit, there is one available for you. Granted, everyone seems to understand that this is not the place to while away the hours and disregard all of the customers waiting in line.
Having said all of that, the food itself was wonderful. Fresh pastas, house focaccia and a kale salad that hubby has even mentioned to others because he feels it needs to be ordered (he is not a salad guy!). On our day, we sampled Pappardelle and Fusilli with rutabaga purée and loved both of them. I strongly believe that this kitchen knows what they are doing and you should trust their flavor combinations.
No matter how daunting the line looks, if you can make the time and are open to ordering what the chef has created, this place will not disappoint you!"
Il Corvo Pasta,Rachel Z.,"I visited Seattle over Thanksgiving and decided to try Il Corvo after one of my friends raved about it. We arrived right at 11am on a Wednesday and the line was already around the corner! We ended up waiting around 1 hour and 15 minutes before we ordered our food at the counter. One thing that really stuck out to me was how reasonably priced the pasta was ($11 each). There are only 3 pasta entrees available to order each day. With a table of 3, we ordered 2 kale salads and one of each pasta offered that day: Pappardelle, Pasticcio, and Calamaretti.
The kale salad was really good. Not a surprise that almost everyone orders it. It's light and very refreshing. My favorite pasta was the Calamaretti, which had a really rich saffron and calamari broth. The Pasticcio was heavier and cheesy because it was baked in a pomodoro sauce. My least favorite was the Pappardelle because, despite the perfectly cooked pasta, the sauce was too dry.
Overall, I definitely think that the pasta at Il Corvo is great but I don't think I would wait in line again for over an hour to eat here. The atmosphere is also very hectic because there's a line of people through the middle of the restaurant. It's really crowded and because you have to bus your own table, it's a little bit of a headache navigating around the huge line of people when carrying dishes and glassware."
Il Corvo Pasta,Jenny W.,"The line is worth it!!! Simple menu so they can focus on making their 3 pastas the bomb! If you're visiting Seattle, I would put this on a must visit list. Consider it one of their tourist attractions. You really can't go wrong with any of the 3 pastas they offer. Since they rotate their pasta choices periodically, order all 3 and share, in case the next time you're there, the one you didn't try is off the menu at the time of your visit."
Il Corvo Pasta,Lindsey S.,"The famous Il Corvo is someplace that has been on my list of places to try out for a while, and so to be in between jobs, it gives me a lot of time to go out and explore. SInce Il Corvo is only open for lunch, I knew I had to go as soon as possible. I went at around 1PM on a weekday and was expecting a huge line and wait, but when I arrived, there were only about 4 people in front of me at the door. Of course inside, the line extends, but I stepped inside fairly quickly. The place does get very, very crowded, but what I loved is that you don't have people waiting around trying to fight for a table. Once you order, the person at the register will tell you where to sit. People seemed to come and go at a pace that was easy for everyone to get seated right after ordering. They have that system DOWN.
We ordered the pappardelle and conchiglinie pasta dishes, and started off with the house focaccia and prosciutto di parma. The two appetizers came out almost as soon as we sat down. The focaccia-AMAZING. A must. Then prosciutto di parma was also DELICIOUS, and I would definitely order both again. The olive oil on the prosciutto was so fragrant ! The noodle dishes honestly, were not the BEST I've ever had, and I felt that I might have had too high of expectations, but they were satisfying. For the pappardelle, it was a little too hearty for me. I like pasta sauce to have a hint of sweetness, and the sauce for this dish wasn't that tomatoey. The cochinglinie was very salty and spicy, and it was good at first, but became a bit overpowering at the end.
I say that I would recommend Il Corvo to those visiting Seattle, and that the wait is worth to just try it out, but in terms of homemade pasta, there are other places that have the same quality for an equal price. Very good, and I will be back to curb my curiosity of their other dishes."
Il Corvo Pasta,Johnny Y.,"I've been here twice with the most recent time being in Nov 2019. While Il Corvo serves really unique and delicious pasta dishes, I was extremely disappointed the last time I went because of certain cleanliness issues.
Food: I've tried the pappardelle and the calamaretti. The pappardelle was delicious with a nice balance of flavor between the sauce and the pasta. The pasta was al dente and cooked to perfection. The calamaretti was a tad bit salty for me but it had a rich seafood flavor. I really liked that it came with calamari as a topping for the pasta. The bread and olive oil was really the star of this place. I really enjoyed the soft fluffy bread with the oil.
Service and Cleanliness: We came around 12:30 and waited 2 hours to be served, but we expected the wait. The issue arose when we found a piece of hair in the calamaretti pasta. We showed the staff and they immediately got us a new plate quickly. However, we found another long piece of hair in the Kale salad. I'm disappointed that it happened twice and I hope they have higher hygiene standards in the future.
Price: Really worth it.
Overall, I wasn't the biggest fan after the second time. I like the dishes and the seasonal pasta offerings, but finding hair in the food definitely made me lose my appetite."
Il Corvo Pasta,Mike N.,"So the question is...Is it worth waiting in line in the rain for 30 minutes to get inside and wait another 20 minutes before you order? Yes! Small restaurant so you need to wait for tables to open before being seated but service is quick upon ordering. Menuu is limited to three lunch entrees. They always have the bolognese and two specials. $10.95 each. Pasta is homemade. Today was Lumache with celery root in a pepper cream sauce and Lasagna with chickpeas, kale and tomatoes in a bay cream sauce. Pasta was perfectly cooked and the sauce was not overpowering and did taste like red pepper. I'm a fan of vegetarian lasagna and loved this one. The blend of vegetables with the cheese was extraordinary. And yes, it was rich. We also ordered sides of focaccia (good-not too oily and perfect for dipping in sauce), kale salad (not a fan of Kale Salad but the dressing made this dish) and a Dulce de Leche shortbread cookie as we needed something sweet to complete the meal Total tab with tip for two was just over $40. You'll walk out needing to go the gym and saying, I'm coming back!"
Il Corvo Pasta,Toni L.,"Word. Waited in a 45 min line with my sister on a Monday morning (around 11:45am). The line moved quickly and there are plenty of hungry visitors that are right in the same boat with you. Like other reviewers have mentioned, the restaurant is small and quaint, the line cuts through the middle and shared tables line the left and right sides of the restaurant.
You order everything at the counter and the chalkboard menu is revised daily, i heard. Dude taking the orders is super chill and patient despite the chaos of so many people bustling in and out. I saw many kale salads and a delicious looking caramel shortbread cookie on majority of the tables so we decided to get those. My sister also ordered the focaccia and then we each ordered our own pastas - i had a vegetarian one (sorry, forgot the name) and my sister ordered the bolognese pappardelle. Waters are self serve (there's wine available too) and then you are instructed on where to sit.
Love the homey, elbows touching, lively jazz vibes here. The food was absolutely worth the hype and wait. Pasta is perfectly firm and chewy and not to mention super affordable ($9.95 a plate). Sauces are simmered to perfection and i was blown away by the flavor on the kale salad as well as the rich intoxicating olive oil that came for dipping with the fresh baked crispy on the outside /fluffy on the inside focaccia.
Caramel cookie was also the perfect end to a hearty authentic Italian meal - shortbread was light and flaky and sandwiched in between was an amazing layer of soft caramel.
If you're on the fence i would 100% recommend giving it a shot. Also line seems to die down pretty dramatically around 2pm so if you don't mind a late lunch I'd say that's the way to go. PASTA FO LIFE"
Il Corvo Pasta,Tina Z.,"We came on a Friday about 1 hour after the restaurant opened. I was absolutely amazed at the line that was already wrapping around the block and even contemplated on eating somewhere else.
We ended up waiting about an hour and 15 mins prior to order. To think I almost didn't try this place saddens me because what a one-of-a-kind this place is. We got their two daily specials as well as their kale salad. Both pastas were literally the most perfectly al dente pasta I have ever had- there is absolutely no doubt the lines are long!
This place opens only for 4 lunch hours 5 days a week. Each day, they make two to three pasta dishes with ingredients all different from the last (menu announced every day about 1-2 hours before opening on Instagram). Some dishes have ingredients I normally would not order in my pasta, but if Il Corvo made it, I would definitely try it."
Il Corvo Pasta,Jennifer H.,"If you're a pasta lover like me, you'll very much enjoy this little gem. Another fellow pasta lover brought me here and I was not disappointed.
There is always a line outside but it's there for a reason. It's the perfect lunch spot. I wish I could go every day just so that I don't miss a single dish they have to offer! Also love the fun antique decorations that gives the store so much character.
Their menu is updated daily with fresh ingredients. Unique handmade pasta with the most rich flavorful sauces! They also have other dishes besides pasta. I got their kale salad and it was delicious!"
Il Corvo Pasta,Lihan C.,"I think hands down my favorite place I went to in Seattle. There is a huge line for this place, but I thought it was worth it. I ordered the classic Bolognese and the Fiore that they had that day, as well as the focaccia. The focaccia was very soft and airy and the olive oil tastes super great. The bolognese is very hearty with meat and is very gritty, but very flavorful and tastes great. The fiore was HANDS DOWN my favorite. It was just a little bit tart and resembled something like a vodka/lemon sauce (although I think it was a different sauce the name escapes me now) it was very pretty and kind of a light orange in color.
The pasta here is perfectly cooked al dente. I was seated at the long table with a lot of other people just going there to enjoy the food and 2 other people took up my lead and also ordered 2 or all of the pastas offered that day. We made friends and everything was great. A lovely experience and I would definitely do the wait again since it was WORTH."
Il Corvo Pasta,Vee V.,"Yep, there's a wait, yep the focaccia is amazing.
I arrived 30 minutes before closing so they were selling out of a couple items, it must have been their flavorful items cause we ended up with their pappardelle alla bolognese and orecchiette with pesto, it was just okay.
Once you order they tell you where to sit if you're dining in, the pasta comes fairly quickly. You grab your own water, napkins, utensils, and bus your own table once you're done.
The bread, yes, they ish is herbaceous, soft with a crunchy crust, and perfectly enhanced by the dipping oil. This was our favorite bite of the meal. The pastas were cooked well, but the pappardelle was way over salted, it was almost inedible. The orecchiette didn't knock my socks off, it was fine.
Factoring in the wait, this isn't a place I must come back to."
Pomodoro,Mike V.,"Why are these restaurants only in Seattle?
It's as if all these great chefs slaved away in the industry for years, and one day woke up and said, you know what? I'm going to buy a small place, house, bottom floor of a building with three chiropractic offices, and just run my own small kitchen where I can float casually between the pan my guests tables, regaling them with stories of my cooking career and adventures, all the while wowing them with absolutely incredible dishes.
What Zouave is for Italian with a hint of southern French flair, Pomodoro is for Italian with a decidedly Spanish/Mediterranean coastline lean.
The chef knocks it out of the park every time we go here, and the service in largely impeccable, but more so when the chef is hanging around your table.
Outside of traveling abroad, we rarely do a full bottle of wine at dinner in the US, as dinners are often so rushed. Not here. And we always take the chefs recommendation on a bottle once we've decided which of his incredible meals we will take on for the evening.
My personal favorites are the Capellini with the fresh dungeness crab (insanely good) and the puttanesca with prawns. And yes, you should absolutely take the chefs recommended additional spice from his special habanero olive oil that you've read about, or if you're lucky and he has it, his secret truffle oil.
We have two places we go every week or two in Seattle, Canon for drinks and dinner, and Pomodoro for the slightly early dinner on weekends, especially rainy ones where you want nothing more than comfort food, smiles and great red wine."
Pomodoro,David P.,"Honestly, I think Pomodoro is the best Italian restaurant in Seattle. I've been to fancier places in Seattle, to cheaper places, but the food and people at Pomodoro are second to none.
I used to live in Boston where I was lucky to have experienced authentic Italian food in the North End area of the city. Being able to get home-y Italian food is one of the things I miss the most about Boston and Pomodoro fills that void for me.
The food is no frills, just good food. The owners and staff are genuine and warm. We would highly recommend checking out Pomodoro!"
Pomodoro,Chris A.,"A chef that's cooked for the King of Spain? Sign me up... xD
I've been living in Seattle for almost 10 years and Pomodoro continues to be one of my go to spots for visitors and for when I want to treat myself! Prices are very reasonable and the food and service is amazing.
Pomodoro is an awesome mixture of Spanish Basque and Italian. I've been numerous times, always ordered something new, and have always enjoyed my meal. Also can someone figure out what is in that avocado pesto that is brought to every table? Its so GOOD! xD."
Pomodoro,Nicole A.,"I was scrambling to find a place for dinner for 5 people on a Friday night, and luckily Pomodoro came the the rescue! It's a smaller restaurant that has a very intimate vibe with dim lighting and a partially open kitchen.
To start we shared two tapas: the ravioli with hummus and truffle, and the calamari. Of the two, I preferred the calamari. The squid tasted fresh and it was sautéed squid rather than breaded and deep fried squid, which was a pleasant change. In comparison the ravioli was a bit too rich and heavy.
For my entree I opted for the paella and I was happy with my choice! The amount of seafood was abundant and the presentation was pretty. I also enjoyed the seasonings and it was cooked well. The only suggestion I would have would be to get a bit more of a crispy layer in the skillet. The rice seemed like it was cooked into a larger batch and then served in the skillet they brought me, so I was missing the slightly crunchy and smoky bits I love in paella. After a while, the texture can be a bit one-note without them."
Pomodoro,Thao N.,"First of all, happy birthday to one of my best friend, Jordan!!!
She's the reason why we discovered this restaurant since I never have a reason to be around this Eastlake neighborhood. The restaurant is super cute, small, and intimate, good thing we had a reservation. Food is great, my angel hair pasta just melts in my mouth. I ordered no shrimp because I don't eat seafood and they offered to replace it with mushrooms, wasn't even expecting a replacement. Everybody's food looked so good too, it was freshly made as you can see the hot steam coming in the air while everybody is eating. Service was excellent considering we did came in a large group. They even came outside to take a group photo for us which you already know, it's time consuming when it's all girls xD
There's unlimited bread as appetizers, be careful or you might actually get too full before your entree comes out. Love this place, nice enough for date nights/special occasions and cozy enough if you casually just want some good Italian food for dinner. I hate cooking, good thing I didn't have to last night.
Tell me about your experience if you've been here or is going to after reading this review:)"
Pomodoro,Jun Li Z.,"Came here on a date in October 2018. The pasta dishes are great and I recall the service was really good. I recommend coming here on dates or with a friend. The atmosphere is quite chill, low lighting which can be romantic or hard for your partner to see the menu ;)"
Pomodoro,Zeena R.,The food was fine but the owner started arguing with some other guests about the freshness of the seafoood and that soured how much I enjoyed myself.
Pomodoro,Jordan N.,"I've been here two times already and both times have been amazing! They have free parking behind the restaurant and can make​ reservations online for big parties in advance.
Both times I ordered the Linguine alla Carbonara con Pancetta, which has pork belly and ​light cream. It was very delicious and satisfying to my stomach! Normally I feel so bloated after eating pasta but I ate the whole damn thing! I also had a malbec (red wine) to complement my pasta. There's also a bread appetizer served with some cilantro butter, so yummy!
Last night I came here for my birthday dinner and the staff brought out a tiramisu cake with a candle. The cake was rich in coffee flavor. The staff was also patient with our large party and even split up our checks and took a picture for us!
I love coming here and would love to try new things on their menu when I have another chance. Highly recommended to those who love Italian and Spanish dishes."
Pomodoro,Jacqueline H.,"Came here for a friend's birthday and had a great meal! The restaurant is in a quiet area of Eastlake and is pretty low key. The chef walks around and takes your order and provides some great recommendations. We ordered the portobello mushrooms and octopus as appetizers. Both were delicious! They also bring you bread that comes with a side of pesto - love when Italian restaurants give pesto instead of bread or olive oil!
For the entrees, we ordered the Gnocchi con Salsiccia e Funghi, paella, and Capellini al Aglio con Polpa di Grancio e Tartufo. The paella was really good and came with a good variety of seafood (calamari, mussels, shrimp) and wasn't overly greasy. The capellini was delicious! I loved the crab meat and truffle oil. The gnocchi was good as well, but my least favorite out of the 3. Additionally we tried their tiramisu and it was amazing! Overall, a great Italian restaurant that is super low key but has delicious food. Highly recommend!"
Pomodoro,Gabrielle B.,Great spot for a special dinner with friends. The homemade oil is outstanding on top of the pasta.
Pomodoro,Janhavi B.,"Pomodoro is hands down one of the best Italian restaurants in Seattle. There are fancier ones, but the food and service here are is unparalleled. I would say that Pomodoro is pricier than some others (e.g. Ristorante Machiavelli) but it more than makes up with the personal touch and the fact that you can get a table way more easily! Located on the relatively quiet Eastlake Avenue - it's almost easy to miss, but their handmade pastas, and dessert (tiramisu and creme brulee) are a must-try. Almost every pasta and special I have tried so far has been delicious so I can't recommend anything specific but highlight recommend a visit here! With 1 entree per person, a dessert and a bottle of wine, it may end up costing you close to $40-50 a pop."
Pomodoro,Lynden L.,"My dining experience at Pomodoro was as a part of a large-party. For those interested in making a large party reservation, they will typically require you to book a time earlier than their normal dinner hours and charge a late/overtime fee if your group shows up late or stays beyond the allocated time.
The service was very friendly throughout the evening and as they were prepared for our party, servers were very prompt as well. They quickly took everyone's individual pasta orders as they sat down and served the caesar salad shortly after. The dressing on the caesar was very flavorful and was not too salty or heavy. It did seem like the lettuce had been sitting in the dressing for a while though-- this might not be an issue with a regular dining experience.
I ordered the Penne alla Vodka, which I believe was the best dish out of the pre-selected options we were given. It was the perfect balance between creamy and tangy. There could've been a bit more sausage or veggies to mix up the texture though. I also had a bite of the Sun Dried Tomato Pesto con Linguine pasta, which was alright, but felt like it was missing a certain 'oomph'. Perhaps some extra spice or citrus (lemon squeeze?) would really brighten it up. The prawns served with the dish were very plump and fresh though!
The tiramisu was average-- we did notice that each piece seemed to have a different flavor profile (more chocolatey, more alcoholic, more coffee) so there was a lack of consistency but the taste was fine."
Pomodoro,Raquel M.,Nope. Terrible food and subpar service. My expectations were perhaps unreasonably high given the website's description of the chef's experience. The bread provided as a starter was neither fresh nor toasted. It had the distinct preservative flavor of poor quality bread. The pesto served with the bread was cold and reminiscent of the flavor of grocery store pesto. Our server was more interested in high dollar tables where cocktails were ordered and it was difficult to get his attention. I had the pesto di pomodori secchi alla puttanesca and the anchovy smell and flavor overpowered everything else. I typically can't get enough pasta but could not finish this dish. My husband had the manicotti al forno and while it was good the walnut flavor was overpowering. The price of our meal was not commensurate with its quality. We've had cheaper meals that were tastier and higher quality. I wish we had skipped this place.
Pomodoro,Jenny H.,"FOOD: Ordered a few different pastas named as their ""popular dishes"" and they were all mediocre. 6/10
SERVICE: Good. Waitress came to check in frequently. Prompt. Courteous. 9/10
**Important to note. One big letdown for me and will be for all parents with babies/toddlers: NO HIGHCHAIRS PROVIDED HERE."
Pomodoro,Amanda I.,"I came to Pomodoro the night after an interview to reward myself and unwind a bit. I ordered the Dungeness crab angel hair pasta special and loved it. Though it was pricey, there was a good amount of crab. I believe it also had some black truffles which added great flavor to the simple butter garlic sauce. They also offer a spicy sauce to drizzle on top and I would highly recommend it. It is a bit spicy so maybe ask to try a little on the side first.
For dessert I got the creme brûlée. This is perhaps one of my favorite dessert dishes so I couldn't resist. I was somewhat disappointed. Instead of the creamy center it usually has, this one was much firmer. The flavor was good but the texture was certainly off. The top tasted like a toasted marshmallow which, again, is not quite what one typically looks for in a creme brûlée. But it was good and I ate it up. However for $9 it is definitely not worth the price.
Service here is really good. The owner is very friendly and chatted to me a little about my trip to Seattle. Other employees were very efficient and friendly as well. The check did feel a little rushed at the end but otherwise the service was great!
If you're looking for somewhere to go for a special occasion this would be a really good option. The food is a little pricier but it is delicious. The ambiance creates a more upscale feel and the service is on point."
Pomodoro,Sloan C.,"Went there last Friday night. Although I was late for my reservation, they were nice enough to find a table for me and my friend. Food was great. Ordered linguine with cream and anise sauce and shrimp. The sauce was balanced - flavorful yet not too heavy. The pasta was topped with some grapes, which I found interesting. I also ordered ab octopus side and it was soooo tender. Would definitely come back again to try other items from the menu!"
Pomodoro,Christina T.,"My boyfriend and I came here for date night and it has become our favorite ""hidden gem"" that turned into an anniversary tradition. We love pasta.
Their restaurant is a small space and being that they're only open 5-11pm, I'd recommend going during the week.
Their bread and dip appetizer is to die for! It's light and fluffy and appetizers set you in for the rest of the meal to come. My boyfriend got the Linquine con Gamberie and I got the Penne Pasta alla Vodka. Delicious, delicious, delicious. If you like everything with a bit of spice like myself, just ask for their sauce! Someone will come by and give you a teaspoon full of their secret sauce.
Customer service is great. The intimate feel of the restaurant is amazing. It's a great place to dine!"
Pomodoro,Annalise W.,"Love this place. Perfect little neighborhood Italian restaurant. Ideal for date nights, celebrating, or if you're just craving some delicious Italian food. Romantic, intimate, and homey vibe.
Portion sizes are generous and food is always consistently delicious. I love their caesar salad. I always get the same entree, the chicken breast with gorgonzola sauce and pasta with red sauce. It's absolutely amazing! Chicken is tender and juicy. I always have a hard time deciding if I want a creamy white sauce or a zesty tomato sauce and I love this dish because I get the best of both worlds. The chicken is covered in a creamy gorgonzola and the pasta is in a light tomato sauce. Portion size is very generous. They also have a house made chili oil that you can ask for on your pasta. It's too spicy for me, but if you love some heat I recommend. I have also ordered the carbonara, which I recommend. I also highly recommend the tiramisu.
Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants in the city! There is also a free covered parking garage that is super convenient."
Pomodoro,Alex O.,"Best fettuccine Alfredo hands down. At least for me. I don't know why but it has such an interesting taste. Different from all the other Alfredo dishes I've had. I just want to eat more and more. It has a Spanish twist to it. If you order it's Polla al Jerez. The tiramisu is also heavenly. I need to stop trying the other desserts and just stick with this one.
The snow crab pasta is also exceptionally good. I need to get this one again. If only I could eat pasta everyday."
Pomodoro,Artemis L.,"I am giving this restaurant five stars despite a couple of unsettling experiences with our waiter. The food is just that good.
My husband took me out to dinner at Pomodoro last night to celebrate my birthday. It is a lovely little restaurant, with creative lighting (red circle lights, tiny twinkling white lights, and warm yellowish-white lights), and crisp white tablecloths.
I had the tomato cream soup, the paella, and I split the dungeness crab linguine with my husband. My husband also had the pork pancetta. My husband is characteristially very unenthusiastic, so when I asked him how his food was and he said ""good"" (he says ""okay"" 95%+ of the time that I ask him this question), I knew that the food was an unusually special experience for him, too!
My food was absolutely outstanding, probably among the top ten meals I've ever eaten. The chef had a lovely long blurb included in the menu about his love for cooking, a few of his famous customers, and his experience as a chef. While I enjoyed reading this blurb, I definitely judged the food on my actual experience of eating it, which was heavenly.
We also ordered a bottle of the Cava Mont Marcal wine. I enthusiastically recommend this wine. It was outstanding.
Our waiter has a very genteel manner, but his memory and attentiveness are unfortunately severely lacking. We arrived fairly late, just after 9pm, and perhaps he'd had a long and busy night before we arrived. He also appeared to be pushing 90 years old.
He smiled a lot and he seemed like he was trying his best, but he basically ignored us for the middle half of our meal. My husband had to literally get up out of his chair three times to go up to him when we needed something. He was just in his own world (also I think partially closing the restaurant, but we just couldn't get his attention for several minutes on end after several tries).
He was respectful and sweet when he did get to us, however, he also brought up four very serious and upsetting topics (communism, genocide, global warming, and immigration), all of which I deeply care about, however, I would prefer very much to focus on lighter, more pleasant conversational topics while eating a celebratory birthday dinner. It was an odd experience - I must say I've actually never had a waiter bring up such topics when dining out.
At the start of our meal, I informed the waiter that I am gluten-free due to a serious medical condition which gluten can aggravate terribly. I was happy to see that there are gluten-free options for many of the dishes, which I requested. He seemed to really listen to that, which is important to me, and I did not flare with my condition after eating my meal.
However, at the end of the night, he brought me out a surprise piece of tiramisu with a flaming birthday candle on it. He had a huge smile on his face and he looked so excited, and I was delighted! However, when he put the piece of tiramisu in front of me I had a scared feeling for a second and asked him, ""Is this gluten-free?"" He said, ""No."" I said, ""I can't eat it then, can you please take it away?"" He said, ""I'm sorry, I didn't know."" I said, ""Yes, you did know, because I told you at the beginning of the meal that I am gluten-free due to a serious medical condition."" He said again, ""I'm sorry, I didn't know."" To be honest, the apology seemed genuine. He seems like a nice person. But it's a little scary that he completely forgot something that could have caused me serious pain.
But then he said, ""well, your husband can eat it then."" I said, ""My husband will not be eating birthday cake in front of me on my birthday that I am not able to eat."" He offered me Spumoni or coffee on the house. I declined.
I feel like he was really trying to make things right, I think he just wasn't getting it. I got upset and asked my husband to pay for our meals and asked my husband to leave a 20% tip to be polite (I usually tip between 23% - 27%). I left the restaurant and waited for my husband in the car while he paid. I feel like the waiter does embody the spirit of service that I look for when I dine out, despite the unsettling errors on his part.
Recommended, but if you are gluten-free maybe double-check more than you usually would. This food is absolutely stunning."
Pasta Bella,Jennifer H.,"HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
Pasta Bella is hands down my favorite Italian restaurant in Seattle. Its a small hole in the wall. The space is tiny and there's always a wait for a table but totally worth it. Not only does the decor feel so cozy and authentic but also the food.
I've been here multiple times for many events and it truly never disappoints. The bread that is served is so divine with the olive oil and balsamic. They also have olive oil roasted garlic you can ask for on the side. The Penn Cove mussels is a great appetizer.
Every single pasta I have tried has been delicious. My all time favorite is the Fettuccine Marsala Fungi!!! Ugh best pasta ever. Their noodles are made to order.. always made and cooked perfectly. Also the Six Layer lasagna is a must try.
My mom loves pasta and is pretty hard to impress with food - as she is a cook herself. I took her here for her birthday and she absolutely loved it.
I would recommend making a reservation. Also make sure you get the deal on Yelp, $20 for $10!!"
Pasta Bella,Jensen M.,"It seemed like this restaurant still felt like a work in progress though the food was promising. It's relatively close to our house and there was a yelp coupon so we thought we would give it a try. The location is not in the downtown Ballard which I think is a perk as parking was ample.
The pasta was good but the service was slow. A single server takes all the orders of the restaurant, everyone else has dedicated roles too. Everyone was nice and the pricing was fair."
Pasta Bella,Sung S.,"Food price was a bit pricy
Food itself was 3/5
The atmosphere is like going to someone home and felt a little crowded even though the place was pretty empty.
If the price was less expensive this would be a good place to eat.
Spaghetti was little watery
Halibut with pasta was good
Bruschetta was a bit overcooked where it was pretty much burnt but at least the flavor was good"
Pasta Bella,Spat S.,"Always great pasta here, if a little on the heavier side. Lasagna is peRfection! Love the huge menu and service is always good. Don't forget to try the desserts too. Feels like you can't go wrong here! Would recommend!"
Pasta Bella,Nathan W.,"Time: Saturday 8:30pm
Service: 3/5 They seem a bit understaffed because the place wasn't even half full but it took about 15 minutes for a party of 2 to get seated even though it was past peak dinner time... Once we got seated, the waitresses were very friendly though and made sure we got our bread, water, and orders taken.
Ambiance: 4/5 2 main dining rooms with a bunch of Mona Lisa paintings and old pictures/paintings on the wall. It's a little dim inside and I'm not a big fan of the color scheme and decorations. Not the most visually appealing.
Parking: 4/5 Free parking in the lot next to the restaurant. Parking lot is a bit small, but there is also free parking on the surrounding streets.
Food: 5/5 I ordered the Penne Salsiccia Gorgonzola ($18) and my friend got the Linguini Carbonara with Sausage ($17 + $4). This is probably the best Italian place I have had so far in Seattle. Both pastas had amazing texture and the sauces were very tasty without being too heavy. Portions were also very big. The pancetta was a little salty, but that's ok. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for some good Italian pasta. I will definitely be returning to try their other pastas. I have also heard the dessert is amazing. Prices are a little on the higher side, but the food is so good that it's definitely worth it!
Overall: 3*0.1 + 4*0.1 + 4*0.1 + 5*0.7 = 4.6"
Pasta Bella,Mackenzie C.,"Super cute, casual restaurant. We started with the gnocchi pomodoro and it was so fresh and the sauce was amazing. For my main dish, I had the Capellini Gamberi Alfredo and it was so so yummy. My boyfriend had the chicken risotto which he enjoyed. The portions were huge - we both took food home, which is surprising as normally when we go out my boyfriend finishes his meal and whatever is left of mine. Really great spot for a casual, but still amazing, dinner."
Pasta Bella,Nancy N.,"This place was amazing!!!! Luckily we made a reservation through the yelp app an hour prior because it's a smaller, cozy restaurant for sure. A handful of people waiting who didn't make reservations when we got there but they still got seated within 20 mins. Ordered a ton of food including mussel appetizers, two bottles of wine, fettuccine, lasagna, and much more. Everything was extremely yummy.
Our waitress was the sweetest and one of our dishes was taking longer to come out, so she gave us a complimentary dessert. Also amazing
Overall 5/5. Can't help that there's a wait for yummy restaurants, so make sure you make a reservation."
Pasta Bella,Aline R.,"I had reservations for the restaurant of Christmas Eve. Did it through their own website, got a confirmation email and went with my life. The day of I called them to confirm and nobody picked it up, SUPER RED FLAG. When me and my husband got there the place was closed. Just that, we ended up scrambling around to find another restaurant since all place open we're operating on reservations and we didn't have one. While we're walking around Ballard Ave to find a new place we heard of people who also had the same problem. So disappointed with this place."
Pasta Bella,Ellie Sam R.,We had no reservation and they were packed but the wait wasn't long. Thank you for putting up with our fussy little eater and not being snobbish about our shared portions. Have it down for a solo date on our anniversary and for special family occasions.
Pasta Bella,Dan C.,"We walked in on a Saturday night and waited only 30 minutes. The service was amazing, the servers, hostes, busser, manager, everyone was so kind. This is the perfect place for a nice date or any occasion. The food was some of the best Italian food I've had in Seattle. I highly suggest eating here! You won't be disappointed, especially if you cherish service that exceeds expectations.
We will definitely be back soon!!"
Pasta Bella,Adam S.,"Easily the best Italian Food I have had in Seattle to date. I'm sad it took me two years to find this gem but so happy that I finally did.
I went with my parents and we were able to order a good bit of food (super reasonably priced) to try.
Every dish tasted fresh and packed with flavor. Definitely did not skimp on the portion sizes as well.
We also got the calamari as an app (sautéed not fried) with olives and tomatoes - it was out of this world.
Go here. Eat here. Come back again and again!"
Pasta Bella,Crystel T.,"*UPDATE (12/28/18)*
Update from my original post - I ordered the Gnocchi again and sadly, it was not cooked. If you look at the picture I posted, you'll see the undercooked dough. Also, the pomodoro sauce was very sweet this time around. Hated to throw away a $10 appetizer."
Pasta Bella,Zacarias D.,"I decided to try out Pasta Bella for dinner on this Sunday night because I have driven past the restaurant a million times in Ballard and I'm glad I came to try it out.
The scenery of the restaurant is very old fashioned Italian feel. The hostess greets you with a wine menu. All of the pasta's and dishes are very authentic. I had a great spicy wine sauce linguine pasta and the noodles were Al dente! With my pasta I had a glass of Pinot Grigio that went perfect with the pasta.
For dessert I had the TiraMisu which was delicious chocolate had a coffee taste and was moist. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for authentic pasta. This would be a great place to celebrate a birthday or anniverary with your loved one or even just a date. I will be back for a special occasion"
Pasta Bella,Viraj H.,"Pasta Bella is a cute little italian restaurant in Ballard. It's a great alternative to the upscale italian restaurants you generally find, and has an old school charm to it.
The restaurant feels like you're walking into a house. They have two separate rooms/sections, both pretty identical. The decor isn't very fancy, but rather cozy and homely, and the ambiance is pretty quiet. Great low-key date place.
Though the place is pretty large, most of their tables seat four, so a large group may not be the best here.
The food was delicious. We tried four different pastas, and they were very good. I specially liked their raviolis.
We got a half bottle of wine, but surprisingly it was served in a carafe, not in a bottle. I wasn't very happy of how it was served, and would have preferred some clarity on that upfront.
The service, though mostly fine, seemed lacking in warmth. Our original server was very friendly and helpful, but the manager/owner? lady seemed very cold and rude. They kept switching servers on us, and the lady seemed annoyed with our requests for water refills. They forgot our soup (and didn't charge for it as well), which was pretty surprising, but not a big deal.
The prices are at par with the competition, sort of on the higher side for a comparable restaurant.
Overall, it's a cool place worth going to occasionally. Not my favorite italian restaurant, but not bad either. Would recommend!"
Pasta Bella,Raj S.,"This is one good Italian restaurant we've been to. The ravioli and gnocchi were amazing! Minestrone soup personally didn't like it much. But my friends loved it.
Note: Make sure to call before you go. They weren't accepting walk-ins until 8:30pm when we visited."
Pasta Bella,Chloe Z.,"Booked a reservation on Yelp weeks ago for tonight at 6:00pm (Christmas Eve) and boyfriend and I walked all the way there in the cold to discover it was closed. Massively disappointed and ended up walking to our backup reservation that I'd cancelled in favor of Pasta Bella. I'm sure they must've received some sort of notice when I made the rezzie, why not tell me they wouldn't be open?!?!"
Pasta Bella,Megan R.,"Small local joint, reasonably priced, large portions, tasty dishes and super friendly service. Is it the best ever probably not but to have a good experience all around, I'm happy and will frequent regularly. $10 off if you check in with purchase of 2 entrees."
Pasta Bella,T R.,"Had Christmas Eve reservations at 5:30pm for four but the restaurant was not open. Two other parties showed up for their dinner reservations while we were there and also went away hungry. Some very unhappy people in that parking lot. Funny that PastaBella could not take the time to reach out and cancel the reservations; not even an explanatory sign on the door! It will be a distant day before we give them another chance.
BTW, I emailed Mike@PastaBella with news of the reservation issues and never even received the courtesy of a reply. Very poor form."
Pasta Bella,Marco M.,"This meal was a disaster. The food was about 3 stars but the service was so awful I'd give zero stars if possible.
My wife and I are on vacation in Seattle with another couple. They took us out the previous night so we wanted to treat them to a nice meal tonight. Since our last vacation together was in Rome I thought Italian food would be a good choice.
I made a reservation for 4 through Yelp and we arrived right at 7:30. We were greeted and seated promptly. A few minutes later our server brought water, warm bread and olive oil. So far, so good.
We ordered appetizers and entrees. We drank water, asked for refills as it was a hot day and the restaurant did not have air conditioning. We asked for more bread. 45-60 minutes went by with no food. My wife asked the host and she explained that they were short staffed. She said to let her know if there was anything she could do. There seemed to be four tables occupied so it wasn't crowded but I think there was only one cook. It would have been nice if we had been warned there would be a very long wait for food BEFORE we were seated, or at the very least, before we ordered. We shouldn't have had to ask where our food was. Also, they could have offered complimentary drinks at that point.
The appetizers came soon after our inquiry. My wife and one guest enjoyed the shrimp pesto appetizer. We also had the special sun-dried tomato pistachio crostini. Two of us liked it, two did not. We also had the gnocchi in creamy tomato sauce which was ok. And I had the Caesar that was also just ok.
Then we waited. And waited and waited. The host cleared the appetizer dishes and asked if we wanted dessert menus. We explained that we were still waiting for our entrees. Perhaps she was embarrassed, who knows, but from that moment on she became rude and unpleasant - details to follow.
Our entrees finally arrived a full 90 minutes after we were seated. One guest and I split the puttanesca and a vegetarian version of the gnocchi. My wife and other guest shared Halibut with citrus sauce and linguini Amatriciana. All of the pasta was over cooked. The puttanesca sauce was fine. The gnocchi was ok. My wife liked the halibut but our friend didn't care for it. By the time the food arrived we were rather irritated.
The waiter said he would comp dessert and drinks. He cleared the table while my wife was still eating and even brought dessert menus before she had finished her meal. Only two of us wanted dessert and three coffees. They tried to get cappuccino or espresso but the waiter said the machine was broken. RIGHT. Then they asked for plain coffee. He said that since they closed at nine it was too late to make it. I pushed back saying it wasn't our fault that we waited an hour an a half to be served entrees. He acquiesced and brought out two decafs. The host brought out the two desserts and practically slammed them down on the table. Then the coffees and one tea arrived. She brought out a handful of little tiny portions of half and half and flung them onto the table. All of this with no eye contact or one word from her. After she left we had to laugh because her behavior was so ridiculous.
Then we waited and waited for the bill. We finally were getting up to leave to pay at the register when the bill came. At that point the host said some pleasantry as if she hadn't been awful for the past several interchanges.
I usually tip 20% or more on the entire bill but I only left $10 which was 10% of the pretax bill. In retrospect, I should have left nothing. The waiter wasn't rude, he just didn't let us know there would be serious issues in getting our food and then made a grand gesture of comping things he didn't have or wasn't willing to make.
Mediocre food and horrible service. We have another week in town and you can be sure we will not return here."
Pasta Bella,Julie R.,"Delicious dinner. Bread course includes garlic confit under oil. So rad. Generous portions fed my teenage boys impressively. Great service, attentive, charming and authentic. Love it!"
Assaggio Ristorante,Alex O.,"Arancini Score: 3.5/5
Deep fried cheesy risotto served with light marinara sauce. Perfectly crispy. Has a nice crunch to it and has plenty of cheese pull!!! However, it was not very creamy and had a subtle taste. The added peas were a nice touch though
Gnocchi Score: 2.5/5
I was excited for this one but was let down. If you eat the gnocchi by itself the Gorgonzola cheese sauce is way too overpowering and goes straight to the nose. However, the flavor subsides when combined with walnuts.
Rigatoni Score 4/5
The pasta has a really nice bite to it. The sausage was on point and goes very well with the red peppers. I only wish that the red peppers were a lot smaller and not so daunting.
Lasagna Score 4.5/5
I have never had good home made lasagna and the best lasagna I have had is frozen. However, this knocks the frozen lasagna out of the park. It's a thin lasagna filled with a good balance of meat, cheese, and sauce. I especially like that the edges are nice and crispy.
Tiramisu Score 5/5
Omg this was so good. It was cool and refreshing. Filled with so much mascarpone cream. Coffee drenched lady fingers in between the layers and a chocolate top. I will get this again and devour it in less than 2 minutes. I gotta stop..."
Assaggio Ristorante,Kayla D.,"A gem around the corner from everything! Delicious Italian food this place comes served with fine wines , kind staff, and excellent service!
Not only does it smell divine, your first bite tastes just as incredible! Came here for a business meeting a rec from the hotel.
Truly a delight !"
Assaggio Ristorante,Dave W.,"Assagio was packed on this cold, wet, rainy, Seattle night. The place felt warm and inviting and our waiter could not have been any better. Really great service.
My wife had the linguini and clams. I had their saltimbocca. We both had ceasar salads. I'd give the pasta 4 stars and the saltimbocca a 3.5 star. A red blend wine from Montepulciano was fantastic.
The place has a vibrant atmosphere and is noisy in a good, Italian way. Definitely recommend!"
Assaggio Ristorante,Jessica S.,"Bra. Vo. Round of applause for the waitstaff, hosts, chefs, and anyone else that I may have missed. This place hits the spot and doesn't miss a beat!
We made reservations day of using open table for a 5:45pm dinner. We were immediately greeted, checked in, and sat right away. We had a lovely table for two. This place is cozy and offers an intimate dining experience. I highly recommend this establishment for folks celebrating or just looking for a delicious authentic Italian dinner.
Food was top notch, after dinner coffee was a real treat, and the service was not a disappointment.
I can't wait to go back."
Assaggio Ristorante,Toni Rose D.,"My partner and I were craving pasta and we literally went to this restaurant because it was the closest to us. I'm glad we checked it out. We sat by the bar so that we could be seated immediately. The restaurant was pretty packed which is always a good sign. The bartender immediately served us with water. I ordered a glass of red blended wine to go with my pasta. I ended up ordering the pasta sampler with three different types of pasta: gnocchi, ravioli, and orecchiette. My partner ordered the rigatoni. The food came out right away. The serving for one pasta is a good size, but I thought that the sampler came in a smaller serving. The orecchiette was definitely my favorite although the other two weren't that bad. My partner loved the rigatoni. For dessert, we got the chocolate cheesecake and it was so rich. We were definitely stuffed. The service was on point!
Restrooms are separated between females and males."
Assaggio Ristorante,Molly M.,Delish! The 3 pasta tasting was amazing. Gnocchi was bomb! Great atmosphere too for a fun night out.
Assaggio Ristorante,Jan M.,"We were in town for a long weekend, and our normal place, Tulio, was closed for renovations....so we needed to find a new Italian place to eat dinner. After doing a bit of research, this place seemed to be ideal, as it has a few fish dishes, some vegetarian dishes and looked quaint and cozy from the pictures.
Upon arrival, we were seated immediately (as we did have reservations). First impression overall was good - this place was busy and bustling with energy. I was excited to see several specials for the night, and three of them were fish! The wine list was also very extensive with Italian wines from all regions. We asked for a recommendation from our waiter, and we went with it. He was spot on with the wine - it was fantastic!
We started with bruschetta, which was fresh and not too garlicky, just the way I like it. My partner had the minestrone soup and said it was fantastic. For entree's, he had a basic pasta puttanesca and I ended up ordering the baked eggplant, even though the specials looked amazing.
Food arrived quickly, and I will say, the flavors were overall very good, but the eggplant was a bit odd. Usually this is served with eggplant cutlets, but I found that there was mostly the skin of the eggplant with very little of the vegetable middle (the meaty part), so it was a bit tough and not that enjoyable. I think I was just unlucky, but this is the reason I gave this place 4 stars versus 5. My partner really enjoyed his pasta.
Would I come back? Yes, but I still prefer Tulio and will return there next time I am in town."
Assaggio Ristorante,Jen W.,"20 years later, we visit again And have a very yummy dinner. And the Tiramisu!!!
we parked 2 blocks away in the Amazon building because it was free on the weekends...and saw there is free parking Across the street lol"
Assaggio Ristorante,MyAnne K.,"My new favorite Italian Restaurant in the city! Assaggio nailed my favorite dish, ""Cioppino""! Full of flavors and packed with delicious fresh perfectly cooked seafood in a spicy light tomato based broth. Right on!!!! Wine list is great. We had a bottle of a spicy Sicilian wine. Dammmmmnn good!
Service on point. Both times I dined here, was nothing less than perfect.
The vibe in this restaurant is lovely, welcoming, and warm. I was able to reserve a table for 4 on a Thursday night. The place was packed! Full of families, couples, and business people. This place is for everyone. Cannot go wrong here. Love you Assagio!!"
Assaggio Ristorante,Caitlen S.,"Super unimpressed... went here for a date night on vacation with my boyfriend, after being given suggestion by the concierge and looking at yelp. The only thing that was worthwhile here was the oil for the bread! We asked for a second basket, that's an extra charge and it came literally after we had finished our meal. Our entrees came out SO fast they must have been microwaved, but one of our meals was barely warm! Lastly, we attempted to experience the highly recommended zeppole - not worth anyone's time or effort. Both the pastry and dipping were hardly considered good.
I had high expectations for this restaurant, and am truly disappointed it didn't satisfy. It also didn't help that a group sitting somewhat near us who were friends with the staff were literally yelling and laughing so loud I couldn't hear anything my partner was saying without having to repeat myself in a loud voice. Several groups around us were giving the table looks, as it was an obvious annoyance.
When it came time to use the bathroom, one of the two toilets was majorly clogged with lots of toilet paper, and the other had globs of wet toilet paper on the back portion of the toilet. Either way, it was undesirable to want to use and a rather easy thing to fix, something necessary in a busy restaurant to maintain.
The ambiance was clearly not fulfilled given the attempts. I would not return the next time I'm in Seattle."
Assaggio Ristorante,Nathan S.,"I couldn't find parking and had to park 4-5 blocks away, so I was already grumpy by the time I got to my table.
Our seating was fine (next to front window), but I noticed that the dining area is a very cramped, almost claustrophobic space.
Anyway, our party ordered drinks. I asked what beers they had on tap. The waiter listed them and then asked if I was local. Weird question, to which I replied, ""Yes, and I'll take the Fremont.""
The drinks were fine. My beer was good and somebody ordered a well-made White Russian.
When the waiter returned, we ordered some appetizers. This process was difficult because after asking for recommendations, our waiter tried to up-sell us on a $50.00 main dish, claiming that we could split it three ways and wouldn't lose our appetite. Then when we asked for another recommendation, he said, ""The gnocchi is good...""
At this point, I'm thinking to myself, ""Wtf is wrong with this guy...that's another main dish."" I decided to end this awkward interaction and blurted out, ""We'll take some bruschetta.""
So, off he goes with our appetizer orders: one member of our party had ordered some type of shrimp or prawn appetizer and another had ordered what looked like deep-fried green olives.
Shortly, the appetizers arrived, minus my bruschetta. It was also at this point that we decided on dinner.
I ordered their margherita pizza, somebody else ordered their fish, and another guy ordered some pasta.
Long story short, their margherita was one of the worst neopolitan style pizzas I have ever had. I took a few bites and refused to eat anymore.
I tried a little bit of the fish dish and it was good, but can't comment on the pasta.
After that, I desperately wanted to leave, but unfortunately other members of our party decided to order dessert: cannolis and lemon sorbet.
The sorbet was a frozen travesty and barely edible and the miniature cannolis looked like tiny unappetizing weiners.
The total cost of this abysmal experience came to $188.00....even without the forgotten bruschetta.
I won't be returning to Assaggio and recommend that consumers choose somewhere else to dine."
Assaggio Ristorante,Tiffany G.,"We tried this place recently when reservations for Lola next door were full. I made reservations a few days before, this was our first visit here. We started with the caprese salad and well what can I say, it was basil, tomatoes and mozzarella. Pretty basic and rather underwhelming for $12. We both had the pasta sampler and I have to say my combination was quite delicious. Gnocchi, penne with pancetta and oriettcheta with beechers cheese. I would definately order that again. We split a dessert, a lemon sorbet of sorts. It was tasty but rather basic again. Service was prompt and courteous. Cute ambiance, overall a decent dinner. I'm giving it 4 stars because not sure it was worth the price tag. I would still rather have gone to Lola next door given the option."
Assaggio Ristorante,Lawrence L.,"We came here as part of a dinner tasting spree. With limited time in Seattle and too many good restaurants we wanted to try, we started getting single dishes at places. Here we got the Pasta Tasting dish and she loved it! I really liked it. The gnocchi, risotto and papardelle were great but the papardelle definitely took 1st place for both of us! The garlic for the bread was also amazing. I'd probably go back just for that!"
Assaggio Ristorante,David K.,"Had a great dinner at Assaggio tonight! Clams and mussels, followed by Risotto with squid ink, halibut, prawns and who knows what else! Delicious! Fantastic Italian wines, espresso, Grappa and Limoncello to finish our meal! Amazing !
We have eaten probably 15 meals at Assaggio in the past 23 years. We have NEVER had a bad meal. I don't know where a bad review might come from since we've never had a bad experience.
Such a wonderful atmosphere, Mauro has always greeted us as if we are family. We hope to visit Italy with Mauro in the next few years! Felicidades!"
Assaggio Ristorante,Jessica G.,"Super disappointing.
I took a new employee here (visiting from out of town) for dinner because of the good reviews, location, and ambience. Plus, I figured you can't really go wrong with Italian food, right?
WRONG! This place was disappointing on so many levels. I booked through Open Table, which actually went seamlessly. Got seated at a cute and quaint table right by the window, perfect for people watching. And then I noticed them...the fruit flies. EVERYWHERE. On the bread brought to the table. Floating around in the air. Lounging around on our table. Making themself at home on and in my wine. *shudders*
I spoke to the waitress and the hostess, and all they could say is that it was due to the cold weather. But, I eat out a lot this time of year and never experience this, and certainly not in a nice restaurant. I did get my glass of wine taken off the bill, but I could barely stomach eating my meal. I didn't see any fruit flies in my meal, but I'm sure had I let it sit there long enough, they would have made themselves right at home.
Sad. I love Italian food, and I was really hoping that this experience would be better and not so embarrassing for a new employee I had flown up for a work trip."
Assaggio Ristorante,Eden A.,"This restaurant was yummy but I'm not sure that it was quite worth the price. Some of the staff were curt and off putting, but our server Fabio was the sweetest guy. Would not go back, but not too sorry I went."
Assaggio Ristorante,Sam S.,"The atmosphere, service and food were top notch. My only complaints were that the table was too small and the chairs are very uncomfortable.
I recommend the brochetta and Chicken parm. Cappuccino was also good."
Assaggio Ristorante,Corri M.,"Fabulous Italian restaurant!
.
Ordered the meatballs as an appetizer. I had the penne alla vodka (requested shrimp instead of pancetta) & my husband had the chicken parmigiana. Zeppoles for dessert. OMG, everything was absolutely delicious!
.
Was visiting Seattle and this spot was recommended by a local. Definitely a winner. I do recommend making a reservation for dinner hours on the weekend."
Assaggio Ristorante,Shreya K.,"3.5 stars-- Was craving pasta for a while and wanted to try a new Italian place in the city so decided to give Assaggio a try. My boyfriend and I ordered the Gnocchi as well as the pasta tasting with Pappardelle and the Orechiette. My boyfriend loved the Gnocchi as he likes the strong flavor of Gorgonzola. It was a bit too strong of a flavor for me but I thought the other two pastas were very good. For $20, however, the portion size of the Gnocchi was extremely small. Another issue was the bread they served at the beginning was very cold. Not even room temp, but out of the fridge cold. We finished the meal with a tiramisu which was surprisingly pretty large! The dish itself was average-- nothing special really. Also, service was mediocre, the host wasn't super friendly and neither were servers. Overall, a pretty average experience."
Assaggio Ristorante,Josef K.,"Loud, but not too shabby. Sat at the bar for Happy Hour and had Brussels sprouts, meatballs, olives, and sausage pizza. It none of it was extraordinary. Just okay. If you're on 4th in Belltown and want something average and predictable, give it a shot."
List,Helen H.,"My new Monday night spot, when they have all day happy hour!
This time I got the
- burger: decent, wouldn't buy again
- flatbread: yum though a bit heavy on the feta
- truffle gnocchi: delicious, so so so so delicious, must have!
Service was fast too, they don't take reservations, and lastly sitting near the door may be a bit cold!"
List,Katherine Y.,"During happy hour everything on ""The Food List"" is 50% off! The restaurant is much smaller than expected but it didn't feel cramped.
Gnocchi- MUST GET! The best gnocchi I've ever had. So soft and pillowy. It melted in my mouth.
Clams- Tasted fresh and clean
Bacon wrapped prawns- great combo of sweet and savory
Cannelloni- tasted like a giant cheese ball. Didn't have much dimension.
Natural Beef Shoulder Tenderloin- meh, passable. Steak was too charred and lacked flavor.
Grilled Chilean Sea Bass- light flavor on the fish & salty veggies."
List,Andrew S.,"Read the reviews for this place so decided to come with my girlfriend for date night. We were visiting from Vancouver BC Canada so had to try.
The ambience is dark with some overhead chandeliers with dim light bulbs. The music is loud and more of dance style/fast beat so it was a bit odd. Maybe the music is to get people to eat faster. We were at the bar as it was packed. They don't take reservations so I don't recommend coming as a large group. Maybe max 4 people in a group.
The food was good. We ordered the octopus salad, gnocchi and beef tenderloin steak. The octopus was good, had a nice charcoal taste with a little spice. It wasn't chewy or overcooked. The gnocchi was super soft that you didn't really need to use a knife to cut in half. Our gnocchi dish seemed smaller than what other people had posted before. The tenderloin was supposed to be medium rare but seemed more medium. It was still tender and the sauce tasted like a red wine reduction.
We didn't take any photos of the food since the bar has red light so everything would have looked super red."
List,Julie S.,"Happy hour is all day on Monday's, and the deals are amazing. $20 bottle of wine, and half off of all plates. Total score, and the food is amazing. The gnocchi is the best dish ever.. if I could eat it every day for the rest of my life, i would die happy.
As echoed in some of the other reviews, the wait can be pretty frustrating. They might say it will be a 20 minute wait, but then it will end up being close to an hour. It's usually quicker to get a bar seat.
Most people who come here return several times after because the food is so good, and it's a special experience."
List,David B.,"Review based on a great tapas type bar visit.
We sampled a whole bunch and came away impressed all the way.
Cocktails were righteously made. Wine pours generous.
Arugula salad near perfect. Meatballs delicious.
Gnocchi right on target. Shrimp great.
The only downer was the choice of tomatoes for the heirloom salad. They were tired and mealy. Based on the rest it was just an oversight.
Looking forward to the next few visits."
List,Dominic D.,"After reading endless positive reviews and seeing a 4.5/5 rating, I was super exited to grab food here on date night. We dropped in on a Wednesday for happy hour food/drinks (6pm). Loved the prices, but admittedly didn't love the food.
First, I will comment that prices are exceptionally good during happy hour. Also, their happy hour stretches a bit longer than most. From a food perspective, I wasn't in love with most dishes. Octopus salad smelled slightly fishy (possibly fish sauce?), and could have been grilled a little longer for my liking. Ahi tuna needed more flavour--salt or brine (miso/soy) would make this much better. Baked broccoli wasn't really baked, or not to our expectations (ie. crispy, crunchy). Gnocci with black truffle was my favourite. Lots of truffle flavour. Definite recommend. The clams in broth also lacked good flavour.
Ambiance is interesting. Dark romantic lighting, but music reminded me of a dinner club. More upbeat/dance."
List,Ruth C.,"The happy hour here is incredible: half off items on the food list, beer for $4.50, and wine for $5.50. The handmade gnocchi with black truffle cream is to DIE for! It has the perfect texture and the creamy sauce is so delectable. Additionally, the baked broccoli is perfectly crispy and seasoned, and honestly is a thousand times better than Black Bottle's blasted broccoli (which everyone seems to love). List's baked broccoli is the broccoli dish you *should* be raving about.
My husband tried the grilled chilean sea bass and the lamb and beef burger with potatoes. He enjoyed both and would also give List a 5-star rating.
I love the lighting and atmosphere. It's small, cozy, and intimate. The dim lighting makes for a romantic date night, but it doesn't feel uppity at all, so you could totally still come here for a bite with friends.
Staff and service are great. Be sure to have your ID ready at the door, as you have to be 21+ to dine here.
Overall, highly recommend! A gem in Belltown."
List,Heath D.,"LOVE this place. We were wandering around Seattle downtown at night and had already had a very poor and expensive experience at a renowned restaurant down the road. Came across this gem and it did not disappoint. The drinks were fabulous. The food was tapas style and we dove into plate after plate to try an arrangement of different meats and seafood. Happy Hour was kicking and we are so glad we found this place. Clean restrooms, friendly service staff, and constant refills of water with ICE! Can't wait to return and enjoy everything List offers."
List,Kristie C.,"Oof I feel really bad doing this, but the food was not my jam.
- AMBIANCE: dark and loud club lounge music (can't hear your own thoughts) and IKEA PLATES!!! And a mix of other plates too but wow haha.
- PRICE: half off was great before 6:30, but tbh I think it's the optimistic side of the fair value of the food (most items $11-18 at full price, portions more like tapas) $25pp after discount which wasn't bad but wasn't edible
- FOOD: I couldn't eat more than a bite of most items, didn't like :(
TLDR: friendly service, nay to the loudness and not good food. will not be back :(
----
Listing full prices (BEST TO WORST)
- flatbread $12, GOOD: the only thing I'd get again. Chewy flatbread and cranberries. Love feta
- tomato salad $11, PASS: 3 tomatoes, and a tofu looking stick of cheese
- baked broccoli $10, PASS: broccoli soaked in evoo and garlic, nothing you can't make at home
- chicken $14, Yish: can't even see it below the bizarre Marsala looking sauce and mushrooms. Sauce was like a fusion sweet and sour? With pounded and likely floured chicken? Not a fan
- sea bass $18, Yish: fishy and frozen tasting with a base of tomato something risotto I couldn't get on board with"
List,Dhanashree A.,"It has been on ""to try"" list for the longest time. I have been here once two years back but I didn't remember what I ate. Only remembered that I had loved the food. But the lines always scared me away. Decided to make the trip from Bothell during winter break so we came here on a Thursday at 9 pm for their happy hour. They still had a few tables open and we were seated immediately. You gotta love the happy hour deals here. All food items except featured ones are half off, the house red and white by glass is 5.50 $, by bottle is 19$ and draft beer is 4.50$ per glass. If I lived close by I would be a regular here.
The food is just fantastic. I loved their flavors! Everything is on point and the seasoning is phenomenal. We tried their gnocchi with truffle oil, sea bass grilled, clams is white wine sauce and crostini, octopus salad, chicken in mushroom sauce and their chocolate tortino dessert. Everything was amazing would recommend all! Specially highly recommend their gnocchi, it's the best I've had so far. The hype is real. We loved it so much that we ended up getting one more plate. The flavors were bang on across the board. Plus all of this at half price off!! The dessert was a moist chocolate cake with hazelnut gelato. If I have to nit pick, I think the sea bass was a bit overcooked, clams were a little sandy and although the flavor of the gelato was awesome, I found it a little icy. But no major negatives! The service is good, nothing much to say there. Our server was nice, she did her job, nothing more nothing less.
After one drink each, 6 food items and one dessert we paid 77$ before tip between 3 people! Don't miss this place, specially in their happy hour and they have it everyday. I can't believe it look me 2 years to go back. I won't be waiting that long before my next visit!!"
List,Autumn S.,"I loved the gnocchi! If I ever visit Seattle again I will def be back. We went for my birthday dinner and I enjoyed everything from the gnocchi to the drinks and dessert.
FYI the bacon wrapped shrimp are SPICY, it set my mouth on fire."
List,Phattra V.,"Definitely recommend trying this place on a Sunday when it's all day happy hour. My boyfriend and I arrived Sunday night, a little after 8pm, and were seated immediately. The atmosphere is trendy yet cozy and casual. We order 5 plates: Calamari, Octopus Salad, Canneloni, Clams, and Bacon-wrapped Prawns. I was dying to try the Gnocci but they had sold out for the night. It's just another excuse to come back, and we will definitely be back. Everything we tried was cooked so well, and extremely flavorful. My favorite dish was the Octopus Salad. I don't think that we could've gone wrong with any dishes that were on the food list, tbh. 5 plates of quality food for under $50, sold."
List,Carol L.,"I really wanted to love List because of how much these reviews raved about the food and the service. But I honestly can't.
I was originally told to wait 45 minutes for my party of 4...but ended up waiting 2.5+ hours. The worst part was that the server was constantly letting smaller groups cut in front of us. As a result, 6 groups who came after us were seated even though we were 1st on the waiting list. I honestly wouldn't have minded the wait, but it's just more frustrating to hear from servers that our table will be ""ready soon"" and then turn to see someone who JUST walked in the door get seated.
The saving grace of this place was definitely the food. It's why I give this place 2 stars instead of 1. We ordered the broccoli, grilled octopus salad, spicy meatballs, handmade gnocchi with black truffle cream, bacon-wrapped wild gulf prawns, and grilled Chilean sea bass. Everything tasted pretty good and I recommend all the dishes above except the broccoli. I think you can make the broccoli at home and it's nothing really special. If you can, go during their happy hour since their dishes are discounted."
List,Winnie Y.,"My friends and I shared a few dishes including gnocchi and chilean sea bass. We also shared a bottle of a white wine (forgot what it was called! but I think it was the only option for that happy hour period). It was busy inside around the happy hour time that we came at, but we were seated somewhat quickly at the bar area that was directly next to the doorway (not ideal, but we just wanted to be seated). We were provided with water, and not soon after, we were asked if we wanted to move to the table out in the patio, which was perfect!
The food was delicious and good quality, especially paired with the wine, and service was excellent. Our waitress checked in on us frequently, but not too frequently, and we had a good time overall. My only warning to future patrons is that while the patio seating is really bright and lovely compared to the dark (and noisy) inside, it does get a bit dusty sometimes and you might find some dusty particles in your beverages lol!"
List,Ashley S.,"PAN ROASTED NATURAL CHICKEN, SEA SALT AND PEPPER CALAMARI, SEARED AHI TUNA FILET
Price: $7, $6.5, $8 (happy hour prices, 1/2 off Original prices)
Ratings: 3.5/5; it's a little pricy if you go after happy hour but quality overall wasn't too bad! There's happy hour on Sunday and Mondays all day, Tuesday-Thursday from 4:30-6:30 pm, 9-midnight, and Friday-Saturday from 4:30-6:30 pm. For happy hour price, it's pretty worth it! We shared about 3 dishes amongst 3 people. It was an okay amount for each dish, so I would recommend getting another dish if this is for dinner. I felt like one dish would definitely not fill me up if this was my meal LOL service was really good though! Definitely recommend getting their calamari as it's seasoned very well."
List,Niyati G.,"Love everything about List - ambience, music and most importantly, the food! My fav is their pink gnocchi. I moved to Seattle from LA and such kind of cool spots are hard to find around here. Another unbelievable fact is, they have happy hour on food starting 9pm even on weekends!"
List,Jeanette R.,"Yum! This is by far one of the best happy hours in Seattle. Delicious plates all half off and an excellent selection of craft cocktails. The menu is extensive for a small place, and even though there are tables outside the bar area, this is a bar and no kids allowed! I, personally like that a lot....
Bacon wrapped shrimp and crispy broccoli, halibut, etc etc etc- I cant remember everything we ordered, but, it was the perfect start to the night.
Bartender was very friendly and helpful and made delicious drinks with creative flair. Try out this place - you'll agree, I'm sure!"
List,Catherine L.,"wow. Went there with a couple of girlfriends and we loved every dish. I will definitely will be back to try more!
Had: the truffle gnocchi (I need more truffle gnocchi in my life!!), the goat flatbread (super good, hearty and chewy bread), the mozzarella salad, which was bright and fresh, the bacon wrapped shrimp (channeling my inner Ron Swanson), and it was delicious!! I also had a cocktail that was really yummy and paired a malbec with the food perfectly. Can't wait to be back."
List,Bob S.,"We had some really great small plates, wine and conversation here. Our server Sarah was super sweet and helpful. We tried the baked broccoli, tomato salad, lettuce/goat cheese and pear salad, sea bass, and chicken w/mushrooms. I could skip the chicken but everything else was fantastic! We also finished off with hot chocolate cake and ice cream... yumm!
Definitely worth a try."
List,Ariella P.,"Yum! We popped into List right as they opened to take advantage of the happy hour deal. Otherwise, this would be out of our price point for a weekend dinner. It's very dark in the restaurant and the mirror walls definitely make it feel much bigger. Hard to take pictures of the food because of this, but I really enjoyed the gnocchi and the goat cheese pear salad. My party mates enjoyed their broccoli and meat balls. Our server was very attentive and friendly. Definitely worth dropping in for a romantic dinner."
Ristorante Machiavelli,John W.,"What a nice find, downtown Seattle -
I wish local-to-me Italian restaurants could pull off the kind of affordable home-made Italian that this place does, right in downtown Seattle, no less.
If I was local, I'd be coming here quite often - I don't know how they make Italian this low of price, and this high of quality. I would have expected to pay more. Heck, in my town, homemade Italian of any kind is starting at over $20 a plate.
This place is comparable in price to Old Spaghetti Factory and Olive Garden (but obviously is worlds better)."
Ristorante Machiavelli,Danielle D.,"TLDR
I'm Italian and from NY--my standards for Italian food are high.
Seattle has a way of taking any type of soul food & making it unapproachable, so when searching through all of the restaurants I was reluctant.
I was given a few Italian restaurant suggestions, but they all were an abrupt ""no"". Through my own search, I found Machievelli. I was hesitant at first--bc yelp photos make it seem like a pizza shop--but
Took a chance.
I was blown away.
There are TWO rooms, a bar area /waiting room and a romantically lit dining room.
Tiny, but the feel and smell brought back NY memories.
I was seated with bread. Thank goodness. Put away 3 plates myself.
Gave them additional tests & ordered the traditional antipast, eggplant parm, & tiramisu.
WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED!
They are a restaurant I will forever go to --and send people to!
Bring cash trust me.
Oh man I loved this restaurant."
Ristorante Machiavelli,Prag R.,"Incredibly LONG wait time. We waited for 2 hours to get a table last night. Wish they accepted phone reservations, wonder how this never bothered them as many Yelpers have given the same feedback!
FOOD-
While waiting for the table, we hung around the bar and ordered few drinks and small plates. They were okay. We ordered the main course as soon as we got seated. The bread was good, soft and fresh. Its free for the first time and you pay on from the second order. We got the Spinach Ravioli and my Veal Saltimbocca and they both were so yummy! Worth the wait time definitely."
Ristorante Machiavelli,Khanh N.,"I am sooo glad I found this cute little place! Shoutout to my boyfriend for finding it on his Yelp search!
This cute little place was packed when we got there around 8pm on a Friday night. We put or name down (they quoted as an hour) and went elsewhere for a drink because the bar area was packed as well. The layout of the restaurant is a bit odd and a little difficult to get in and out with people wait on the bench but I think it adds to its charm. Just be prepared to wait but there are tons of places around to grab a drink or explore :)
We came back an hour later. And they called two names that didn't show and then we were up! They quoted us time perfectly. Going into the restaurant area you can see why it's such a long wait. I think I counted about 14 tables for the entire restaurant.
We sat down. Got bread. We ordered drinks. Drinks came so fast. We got a half carafe of red wine. And then we ordered. And our food came. It was such fast and great service! We felt cared for but also didn't feel like they were bothering us all the time. The bread is from Macrina bakery and it was delish! Our pastas that we got were UNREAL. Such good portions sizes and DELICIOUS.
Best part of this was that it was $44 before tip and we were stuffed and had leftovers. That's definitely a STEAL!!
Probably are new go to date night spot. Seriously love this place."
Ristorante Machiavelli,Nancy W.,"I haven't been here for a few years but still love the place. Very small venue and they don't take reservations so either get there early or plan on a wait. We were here on a Friday night and got to the restaurant about 5:15 and they were just about full, even after opening at 5. As an appetizer we ordered the Bresaola Alla Valtinellese which is cured beef, olive oil and lemon topped with arugula and shaved parmesan cheese. My friend ordered the fettuccine carbonara and I ordered the lasagna bolognese. Both were excellent, although I would have liked to have had more bolognese sauce. Noticed that in between some of the layers of lasagna there was nothing but pasta on top of pasta. Wine was nothing exceptional. Didn't order dessert but now wish I had as they featured a chocolate mousse tiramisu. Big regret there. Small cozy bar with good music."
Ristorante Machiavelli,Tom B.,"I've eaten here 18 years now. Moved away, but every time I come back to Seattle, this is a must. Cozy and delicious. Chicken Piccata
fresh lemon, capers, sweet butter - my personal favourite with a side of spaghetti. Oh man. I need to get back up there! Well done you."
Ristorante Machiavelli,Carol B.,"Honestly, how can you not love this place. It's the perfect place for authentic Italian food and it's so cheap! We've tried so many different dishes here and love each and every one. If I had to make one recommendation, it would be to try the linguine and clams. Don't forget a wine pairing!
Full warning, there's essentially no parking in this area of capitol hill so you should walk or take a ride share. There's almost always a wait, so plan accordingly. The inside is quite small which means it gets loud quickly, but again it's all worth it. We can't stay away"
Ristorante Machiavelli,Jenny C.,"It has been a long time since I've been here and on a Friday night there was about a 45 minute wait. The good thing about their waitlist is, if you miss your spot they'll put you in line for the next table so it is not like you have to wait all over again.
I don't really enjoy the atmosphere of this place and that's the main reason for me not coming back. It's crowded and loud and not in the least bit romantic if you're looking to come here for a date. That being said, I did enjoy the food. The Caesar salad had a good dressing and the lettuce was fresh and crisp. I loved my linguine vongole and that was definitely the better of the two pasta dishes but I think I would be smart and just get takeout next time.
There is a 5% cash discount so bring some cash if you would like to save a little money."
Ristorante Machiavelli,Dione L.,"Me and my boyfriend always walk by this restaurant and have been dying to go. We finally made it over here and literally probably MY FAVORITE italian spot in seattle.
The staff/ service was fantastic. The restaurant was super cozy and fun. The food is super reasonable and portions were good.
The pasta was super fresh i got the spaghetti with garlic and olive oil. Super light and good flavors. I'm going to have dreams about this pasta no joke!
10/10 come"
Ristorante Machiavelli,Janhavi B.,"My new go-to for a casual Italian dine-out experience. Authentic, delicious and not unnecessarily expensive (unlike most Italian joints in town). We were 3 people and shared the red pepper penne with shrimp, the carbonara and a half-carafe of wine! We ended up paying about $25 a pop. You can expect a long wait given its location in Capitol Hill but you can wait with a drink in the bar area and should get in within 30- 45 minutes. All in all - highly recommend for an amazing Italian fare!"
Ristorante Machiavelli,Michael G.,"Trattoria atmosphere, large menu, passable service in a very busy location. Tight tables make for a loud atmosphere.
Extensive menu. We had the eggplant and tortellini with creme sauce, both were spot on. There are so many Italian joints in this general area, this is a good choice for the price. Carafe wine was decent.
We will return."
Ristorante Machiavelli,Victoria H.,"Machiavelli was amazing! It is truly a little Italian treasure on Capitol Hill! I have lived in the neighborhood for a while, but recently decided to try it out and so glad I did!
The only reason I am giving four stars instead of five was the LONG wait. Otherwise, it's a fantastic restaurant! The servers and hostess were all really nice and the food is DELICIOUS. It was definitely some of the greatest Italian food that I have had in Seattle! I really enjoyed the vibe of the restaurant as well. Very hip and casual.
Myself and my friend both had the Chicken Parmigiana and we loved it! It was cooked to perfection and had a layer of sauce over it that was amazing! The cheese melted on top was delicious as well, and to top it off the ground parmesan cheese on top of it made it everything! The spaghetti that came as a sodr dish was delicious as well!
For dessert, I had their in-house made vanilla bean cheesecake, which was phenomenal. It had a Graham cracker crust that just melts in your mouth. One of the best tasting cheesecakes I have ever had!
I definitely enjoyed Machiavelli and I will be returning. :) Please note, if you go on a weekend night, please be prepared to wait a while. However, your wait will be worth it! :)"
Ristorante Machiavelli,Nita L.,"TLDR: Amazing food, cheap prices, ridiculously long wait times for both food and a table.
Food: You get a free serving of bread for the table which was fresh and soft, also much needed because the wait for food was really long. We ordered a half carafe of the house wine to drink, the spinach ravioli - which was creamy and well cooked and my ultimate favorite- The chicken liver lasagne. The chicken liver lasagne takes 25 mins to cook and every bite of it is well worth the wait.
Ambience & Service: This is a cozy restaurant with limited seating so the wait times here are incredibly long. I had to wait for more than an hour to get a table for 2. They don't accept phone reservations either. You can chill at the bar while you wait.
Cost: This is where this restaurant won me over. Cost us just 46$ for a dinner for two people that included 2 glasses of wine per person and 2 entrees. This is a very decent price to pay for the quality of food you get here.
My only complaint is the wait times involved. Else this place is awesome!"
Ristorante Machiavelli,Jenn N.,"We had to wait 1hr, but the food was really worth it.
The Caesar salad with white anchovies was EXCELLENT. Probably the best salad I've ever had, thought it may or may not have been caused by the 1hr wait time. Anyway, the white anchovy add on is a must.
For the main course, I got the chicken liver lasagna. It was delicious, but I also like eating organs (fair warning for those who don't like eating organs normally and want to see if they'd like it. You won't because the distinct flavor was definitely still there)."
Ristorante Machiavelli,Elizabeth K.,"I absolutely loved my meal here! I was in the mood for a more basic pasta dish, something like plain spaghetti with marinara, and Machiavelli offered that. However, I was delighted to end up enjoying the red pepper pasta. It was creamy and full of flavor - perhaps the best pasta I've ever had. After my first bite, I thought, ""can I come here again tomorrow?"" I also got the mixed greens salad, which was served with a great dressing.
The restaurant was busy, but the wait staff was attentive and friendly. One of the staff members took some photos of a group that had finished dining, even though the restaurant was pretty busy. I thought that was kind."
Ristorante Machiavelli,Pinky P.,"This place was recommended to us by family who lives close by. And thank heaven they did! When we first walked in, I was scared we wouldn't get a table. Always a good sign in my book when a restaurant is packed but even a better sign when it's a random Tuesday night!
The service was incredible from the minute we walked in. Everyone was so friendly.
We ordered the chicken parmigiana and the spinach ravioli. The ravioli was delicious and they didn't skimp on the tomato cream sauce. Pretty delicious. The chicken parmigiana blew our minds! We both decided it was by far THE BEST we have ever had! The sauce was so perfect and the chicken portion was perfect. Usually it's too thick and you loose the flavors eating the chicken.
Last we had the chocolate mousse tiramisu. It was also good. I preferred the moose over the rum dipped lady fingers.
The only slight improvement would be the bread in the beginning (which was complimentary). It was really hard and chewy but really does not matter with everything else being so amazing! Go eat the chicken parm here! You won't regret it!"
Ristorante Machiavelli,Sou M.,"My friend was craving carbs a few nights ago and she loves italian, so we looked this place up and decided to go.
When we got there, there was a 30-40 mins wait time (on a Tuesday). We were waiting at the bar area and asked the server if we can just order food or appetizers at the bar and she said we can do that. The bartender, however, denied to take our food order or even showing us the menu!
After finally getting the table, we ordered an eggplant parmesan and a penne pasta with red pepper and walnut. They served complementary olive bread with a mix of olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette which we loved!
The eggplant parmesan was just ok, it was too cheesy and not as breaded as we like. The pasta was really good and creamy.
The server was nice and attentive. The ambience is old and cosy, with dim lighting. The wait time for food was long. The value for price is good since the portions are big."
Ristorante Machiavelli,Srikanth T.,"Two things came to mind when I walked into this place. 1 - it smelled amazing. Maybe it's just bc the rest of cap hill smells like weed, but it was a welcome change of pace as far as smell goes. 2 - Machiavelli was the Italian you chose to go with? There were no other Italians that came to mind, you went with the guy who invented political scheming? I mean fine, I guess, but Ristorante Machiavelli reads like a name that some B level director would name the restaurant that the mob owns in his/her B level gangster movie. Anyways, I was waiting at the bar for 15 min and decided to grab the house red wine. The wine was decent but they poured it in this tiny ass cup, I felt like I was Kahwi Leonard palming a basketball drinking out of it. Surely you have real wine cups, Italian Restaurant. Anyways after we were seated we got served bread pretty quickly - rather than the usual olive oil and pepper to dip, they went with an olive oil and balsamic vinagrette combo, I was not a fan personally, it was more tangy than I would've liked. At this point you're reading this (wow, you're still reading this!) and wondering how I could possibly give this restaurant a 4. Well here's the good - the service was really good, the waitress was really friendly and the food came out super fast. I ordered the chicken Milanese and it was pretty decent. It was a little on the lemony side but the chicken was cooked well. I can't expect the same quality of New York Italian places but it was solid. The spaghetti wasn't perfectly al dente, but it also wasn't like barilla pasta. And it was only about 20 bones for an entree and a red wine. I wouldn't take an out of towner here, but it's not too bad.
3.5 star Sriview, truthfully it's a 3.5 not a 4, but I'll round up cause I do appreciate good fast service."
Ristorante Machiavelli,Richard S.,"Top 10 dining experiences we have ever had. Never would have found this place if not for the recommendation of a bartender in downtown Seattle. Just goes to show you. Talk to your bartender. They know stuff.
It's in the Capital Hill area in a quaint little corner building with a homey comfortable feel. There is a small bar area in case there is a wait or you need a liquid appetizer. Wine list was adequate and plenty
Of cocktail and beer options.
I'm not sure if the bread was complimentary or if there was a cost but regardless it was completely necessary and appreciated. Half of the bread that I'm sure was a sourdough had green olives baked right in (see pic). And to gild the lily they offer a calamata olive tapenade with anchovies and mozzarella that will blow your mind. Salt on salt on love.
Chicken Piccata in a butter and caper sauce = 11 out of 10. Gnocchi al Sugo = same. Service = above and beyond. So good we didn't stop to take a pic.
Go to here."
Ristorante Machiavelli,Edward S.,"This is a classic Italian restaurant like you might find in NYC, Chicago, or Boston (and they have been in Capitol Hill since 1988 which is very impressive).
I ate at the bar, which is small but has great service. I ordered a half carafe of the house red, which was really good for the price. They also give a basket of olive bread which is outstanding (they offer to sell second basket and I could see doing that if I were eating with another).
I originally ordered the lasagna, but since the bartender said it might take half an hour I switched to the Conchiglie della Casa (pasta shells with sausage and marinara). I was not disappointed with the switch. It was served really fast and was delicious. The pasta was nice and fresh, the sausage had just the right amount of spice, and the sauce was perfect.
I will definitely be back."
Tavolàta,Rebecca W.,"This place has serious date night vibes with the dimmed romantic lighting and with their awesome happy hour you can do date night on a budget! I came to celebrate my friend's birthday recently and the whole experience was amazing! The hostess was super nice and made an exception by letting my two friends sit in the bar area (HH area) before I got there (usually the whole party has to be there). The food tasted amazing at only $12 a plate on the happy hour menu it's a steal!!! They also didn't skimp on the size like I expected for HH and instead the plates were full dinner size. The drink prices were also pretty good with $6 for a well drink and $$4 for a San Juan hard seltzer.
I ordered the spaghetti with chicken ricotta meatballs and I'd give it a 4/5 stars. You can definitely tell the pasta was homemade from the great texture and the sauce was light, but well flavored. I liked the meatballs, but I wish you could taste the ricotta more and that they did 3 slightly smaller meatballs instead of 2 massive ones. I'd definitely order this again! My friend had the Pappardelle and from the one bite I tried I it also tasted really good!
I'm definitely coming back and I highly recommend this place for happy hour (5-7pm)! I might even come back and try the full dinner menu. Thanks for the quality food/drink and I can't wait to come back!"
Tavolàta,Zachary H.,"My gf and I went here for our anniversary.
We were hoping to get the happy hour deals but the bar was full so we sat at a table. It's a bit annoying that the happy hour is only offered at the bar and not at the tables. If I sat 3 feet away from my table seat my dinner would've been deeply discounted for the same food. Oh well.
Upon being seated, the waiter gave us each a small glass of champagne and wished us a happy anniversary. That was a kind gesture and was appreciated. We ordered some drinks and our meals and waited in anticipation. I ordered the pappardelle and my gf got a carbonara dish. The food was stellar. When it arrived at the table it was one of those dishes that doesn't look like a lot of food until you start eating it. We also ordered the bruschetta with smoked salmon. It was tasty but I'd probably try another appetizer next time.
The service was exceptional and food was awesome. I hope to return at some point and hopefully get a spot at the bar for happy hour!"
Tavolàta,Kamara S.,"Out of all the Italian restaurants I visited in Seattle, I have to say Tavolàta is one of my faves.
I have been to both restaurants multiple times. In fact, once I came an hour early because I thought it opened at an earlier time. Of course, I couldn't show my face for a period of time after that.
This review is for the Belltown location. The people there are friendly as you walked through the door and explain to you that happy hour (5-7 pm) is limited to the long bar in the front and the side table structure at the very front of the restaurant. I say structure because it glides along the window in a weird pattern that is aesthetically interesting to see.
I have to say this restaurant has a great happy hour. I define a good happy hour as one where you could get a decent meal just off of ordering from the happy hour listings alone. You can get cheap but delicious wine options ($6 bubbles don't mind if I do). Good apps to share (if you are into that). Plus actual pasta options like 2 different dishes of spaghetti depending on your interest. Plus I appreciate that they have an actual dessert on the happy hour menu as well.
Myself, like many others before me, have chosen the gnocchi alla romana thinking it would be the small ones we know. I won't call it a mistake because I enjoyed the dish, but I think they can call it out more so people know what to expect.
But the main reason I go back to this restaurant, even if I have to cross from the Eastside is for something that isn't even on the menu and isn't available all the time. It is... their bucatini carbonara. I know this is not the first place I had bucatini but it is a good reason why I love it. It is not even available during happy hour but I keep going back for it (I try other good things as well).
The worst part is the guessing game in which you have to see it if it would be available. I could call ahead to check but even I am not that ridiculous and I can try other dishes when I get there. I have been there once where they were going to have it the day after I ate there. I was crushed. But it is a great #treatyourself meal if it is available.
Would I bring a big group to Tavolàta? Not in the winter if you are banking on happy hour. But if we wanted to ball on pasta and other treats, sure. If it was 2-3 people, I would definitely try to get a bar seat. It would be a great and interesting date location.
This was my first Ethan Stowell restaurant when I came to Seattle and it has inspired me to go to more"
Tavolàta,Heather W.,"Highly recommend the Pappardelle! Was delicious.
Burrata app, not so much. Their menu changes but it seems they keep different versions of it - when we order it there were figs. Issues were the oddity of the ice cold cheese and rock hard crustinis that are a bit painful to bite into. After enduring for a bit, I decided to ask our server for some fresh bread and that switch helped a bit. If the crustini was a bit thicker cut and more chewy than hard, it would help a lot.
Got 'An appropriate sipper' (bourbon based cocktail) and that was very tasty and enjoyed.
Our table was towards the back along the wall with view into the open kitchen. I always enjoy watching the kitchen prepare meals. Great advertising on their part since it convinced us to get the delicious dessert that was being prepared for a large group. I forgot to take a photo and my memory is fuzzy but since these items change often there isnt much point!
I do appreciate the constantly changing menu; I'm sure this is a popular spot for locals of Seattle. Lovely ambiance, attentive service, delicious italian food."
Tavolàta,Madison S.,"This is my second time to a Tavolàta restaurant. The pasta is pretty dang good. The atmosphere is delightful (think candle light, rustic modern brick, open kitchen). It is rather loud in the restaurant. Can we tough to find good parking, so we paid to park in a lot behind the restaurant. The starter bread was good (not out of this world). The spaghetti dish was really good - noodles were thick and delicious and the sauce was light and yummy. The Pappardelle was good - heavy sauce, orange flavor didn't throw me off a ton, and thick noodles. I preferred the spaghetti dish however because the noodles and sauce were better IMO. The chicken and ricotta meatballs were also very good with the spaghetti. Portions are large - we both took some to go. Price is high.
As a local. I don't think it was worth going again for the price overall, but a nice dining experience for a date night."
Tavolàta,Tara D.,"Food was phenomenal! The duck was amazing, especially the finishing sear. The risotto was creamy and flavorf. Even the starters were great! We ordered the brussel sprouts and squash as well as the bread, and oil and vinegar. Beautiful flavors in everything! I would be happy to come back."
Tavolàta,David H.,"I really enjoyed having dinner for Seattle Restaurant Week here because they allow you to order anything off of their menu, while most restaurants have a limited menu.
For appetizers, I loved the bruschetta. It was well cooked and the smoked fish was perfect on top. This was probably the only appetizer I enjoyed.
For entrees, we had the rigatoni and the halibut. Right away you can see that the rigatoni comes in a pretty good sized serving. The sauce and meatballs were delicious and had a pleasantly spicy kick to it. I definitely recommend this dish! The halibut was pretty disappointing. It was charred, but a little too charred. Some bites tasted like nothing but char, which was annoying. The rice & sauce that accompanies the halibut was good though. If you're interested in this dish, I'd strongly recommend requesting it to be just lightly charred.
The service here was excellent. Our server gave us a good recommendation for wine and was friendly and attentive all evening long. I've heard that sometimes servers at pricier restaurants can be a little biased against you if you're there for SRW, but they really seem to embrace SRW here.
Overall, Tavolata is not one of my favorites for Italian food but it's still pretty good. Personally, I probably wouldn't come back for anything other than Happy Hour or SRW because there are better affordable options around, but if you decide to come here for dinner it's a solid choice."
Tavolàta,Elly L.,"We had their gnocchetti and pappardelle when we visited Seattle last year. The pastas were al dente and the flavors were very good. I liked the pappardelle flavor a lil more. Gnocchetti's flavor was a lil less than what I expected, but nonetheless it was still good. And they give a generous amount of pasta and sauce.
Next time when I'm in Seattle and is craving for good Italian pasta, I would like to come back here."
Tavolàta,Naveed N.,"Yet another Ethan Stowell homerun!
We had reservations for restaurant week- but because I'm a bottomless pit, we figured it wouldn't be enough food and stopping in for happy hour just before would be the right move.
Sat at the bar for happy hour and enjoyed some drinks, and small bites- The baked gnocchi will forever live in my dreams.. truly fantastic.
Dinner/Drinks overall were really great, and I particularly enjoyed the hangar steak they were offering at the time for restaurant week.
It was a bit noisy in the restaurant which made conversation difficult, but I also wasn't expecting a quiet/low-key dining experience so that is okay! I've yet to visit again but plan to fulfill my gnocchi craving very soon. Cheers!"
Tavolàta,Marina K.,Omg the potato gnocchi is the best! Cocktails and service is lovely as well. Great place for family or friend dinner and maybe a first date. We came on a week day around 6pm and got a table no problem but call ahead to make sure they have room. Nice kinda dark ambiance as well. I will def be back!
Tavolàta,Emily H.,"Outstanding pasta! A little pricey, but if you're looking for a trendy (possibly intimate) dinner spot and you don't mind paying a little more for your pasta then check it out! I came here with a group of girls for a friend's birthday and we had a great time. Shared the brussels sprouts, they were a little too salty for me but everyone else liked them. For dinner we each got either traditional spaghetti, the butter noodles, or sausage rigatoni. We agreed the rigatoni with the spicy sausage was the best, but the spaghetti was delicious too! The buttered noodles (called something fancier on the menu) were actually pretty good considering it's a rather basic dish. We shared the donuts for dessert and the chocolate sauce they came with was amazing."
Tavolàta,Sachi E.,"fun fact: they light every single candle every day!! The ambiance of the restaurant was typical for an Italian restaurant. their food was delicious, my opinion a little over priced - still good tho. Their dessert was my favorite part! Highly recommend their creme brulee :)"
Tavolàta,Avelina A.,"I am a big fan of Tavolàta! The ambiance, the food, the service were all top-notch! This is a great place to take your out of town guests or your date. I ended up trying the rigatoni which had a lovely spicy kick to the dish. The pasta was made fresh and really elevated the whole dish to another level. The only dish I didn't care for is the bruschetta. It was made with this smoked salmon that came across as a tuna concoction that did not leave a taste to be desired. But I definitely would come back and try more from the menu since everything else was superb!"
Tavolàta,Joel Y.,"Deeeelicious! Came here on a Saturday night and even though it was busy, was able to find seating almost right away. The service was great, ambience was superb, and the food was yum.
Ordered the roasted beets which were the best beets I've ever had along with the Pappardelle and the Gnocchi Alla Romana. The food was tasty and wasn't too overfilling which was perfect. Also the drinks where outstanding. Definitely a good place to go if you're in the area."
Tavolàta,Sarah N.,"We stopped in for late night food after our flight landed and we are so Glad we came here. We were hungry, tired, and just need a good meal.
This is true homemade Italian! The ambiance and wait staff and accommodating and amazing. They help with suggestions and are prompt to check on you. The food is so fresh, homemade, and delicious. So many flavors go into each dish that make every bite appreciated.
Wine and beer selection is great - cocktails available too. Would recommend or go back if we have the chance!"
Tavolàta,Ellen C.,"I forgot how good this place is, having gone to the Cap Hill location. My friends and I stopped by for dinner Friday night at around 8pm and got seated quickly without reservations. I ordered the rigatoni and let me say that the pasta was cooked to perfection. I ate that entire dish as if I've never had pasta in my life.
Highly recommend if you've never tried this restaurant."
Tavolàta,Julia P.,"LOVE the happy hour menu!! Super affordable and tasty dishes. My personal favorite is the pappardelle, but everything is also delicious. The bread was fresh and warm and the spices and flavors they use in their pastas really come through. I'm no expert in Italian food but and I can tell this is GOOD Italian food :)
If you decide to come here, definitely try go for the happy hour. The bar does fill up quickly so try to come early. Best to come with 2 people."
Tavolàta,Henry L.,"Solid quality food. Love the pasta here. I think the portions are pretty reasonable. I've never had enough to take home and have never left feeling hungry either.
Service has always been excellent when I've been here. The place can get really loud. Lots of concrete for sound to reverberate.
During Seattle Restaurant Week, this is one of my favorites spots. Why? They just let you order off the regular menu while most other restaurants limit the choices."
Tavolàta,Kelsey B.,"HAPPY HOURRRRRRR!
But for real. Come for the HH. Daily from 5-7PM and it is literally the best deal in town. I am actually not sure why people come at 5PM and they choose not to sit in the bar area. Small plates ranging from $6-10 and the pastas are $11-12 instead of the regular priced $18-23. And they sure don't skimp on the portions - definitely super filing (I sometimes even have to bring 1/2 home). Plus some drink specials.
I love everything about this place, a super cozy vibe, you can see the open kitchen with the guys making fresh pasta; and in the summer there is a nice little patio out front for great people watching in Belltown.
Great service, amazing food, date night, girls night, friends in town go to Tavolata you won't be disappointed!"
Tavolàta,Yvette G.,"My friends and I came here so I could carb load before my Spartan race a few weeks ago. One of my friends had been here before and recommended this place.
We conveniently arrived during Happy Hour and ordered the Grand Central Baguette and the Bruschetta. I ordered the spaghetti for my entree. Everything was delicious. I especially enjoyed the marinated caciocavallo and the meatballs. They were extremely flavorful, and really hit the spot. If I am ever in Seattle again, I would definitely return."
Pasta Casalinga,Natasha G.,"This might be my favorite lunch spot in all of Seattle. I wish they were open for longer hours! It's such an interesting find, and I was lucky that I had a coworker bring me here during my first week on the job.
The employees are incredible. They are quick, remember faces, and are relentlessly friendly. You can tell that there are regulars who sit at the bar, who just treasure the experience of coming here. It's a really small menu and venue, but it's definitely part of the charm.
The ingredients are fresh, and they experiment with new flavors - all of them were good. I always went ""from the Garden,"" and was delighted each time."
Pasta Casalinga,Ashley K.,"Utterly fantastic and a wonderful showcase of the market.
Came here for lunch recently with two others. We each had a different item and all of us loved it. I had the Ocean, someone else got the Farm and the third got the simpler pasta with marinara, parm and basil. Each one was amazing. The open kitchen gives you a front row to watch your food cooked while you wait.
The Ocean was a really well-spiced dish. Pasta in all three was cooked absolutely perfectly, tender but toothsome still.
The service was amazing. Everyone was very friendly, and they run that place like a Swiss watch. Wonderful to see a kitchen running so smoothly and efficiently.
When you get your food, you can cram in the upstairs if there are seats, or join the mixed market vibes of the eating area down the stairs (just be careful carrying your plate!). Note, if you're getting wine (which I wanted to, but alas it was lunch on a weekday and I didn't want to fall asleep at work) you gotta stay upstairs to eat.
Would definitely come back for an early, early dinner with too much wine for a romantic market date night."
Pasta Casalinga,Courtney D.,"Great (hidden) Italian spot in the market! My husband has been here for lunch a bunch and I finally got to check it out. I got the ""From the Garden"" meal and it was very good. Honestly, everything on the menu looked delicious, and from what my husband says, it is.
It's one of those casual spots that has the food speak for itself. Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area!"
Pasta Casalinga,Frank L.,"Pasta Casalinga continues to dazzle with great value and great tasting pasta dishes.
I am more of a carnivore so the ""From the Garden"" was a miss for me. It was fine, though I felt garden meant more veggies and there were none.
From the Farm is solid. Could use more meat though! Still love it no matter what. Tasty, filling, a tad rich. Can I request 10% less richness? Then it would be perfect!
From the Ocean, a visual delight on top of taste. They speak for themselves. Again, just a tad rich near the end, but that ain't stopping me from finding any excuse to make a special trip to enjoy late/early dinners!
See you soon!!!"
Pasta Casalinga,Anne M.,"Finally got the opportunity to visit this little pasta store in Pike Place market. It is tucked away upstairs so you have to go looking for it if you want some of its delicious pasta. I decided to order the From the Farm option which was a pork-based pasta dish, while my friend got the From the garden option which had pumpkin. Both dishes were obviously prepared very fresh and tasted delicious, and the wait was not long at all!
The store itself is pretty small but we were able to get some small seating on the bar near the kitchen. They also sell alcohol so we were able to get a glass of champagne and Rose to go with our dishes. Both paired nicely with our orders.
I would say that it is a very reasonably priced plate of food especially for lunchtime with the dishes ranging from $11-$15. I would definitely come back here to try more seasonal options when in the Pike Place market area."
Pasta Casalinga,Amy V.,In love with this place! The pasta is amazing and made when you order. We didn't have to wait too long but expect it to be busy because it will be during lunch time! That day I got the From The Ocean option and it was amazing! I know they have already switched up their menu so this will not be there now but I love how simple their menu is and that you will always get something new. The people are so nice and the flavor is so good! I will have to come back soon!
Pasta Casalinga,Madison S.,"Pasta Casalinga is a small, underestimated pasta only food stop inside a small court within Pike Place market. You walk up to the counter and there's a list of 4 or 5 pasta dishes to choose from. I love this because it tells me that their selection is small (which means in my head, high quality). It didn't disappoint!
The pasta was warm, the sauce was tasty the overall dish was drool worthy. Perfect for a chilly winter day. They had seafood, meat, vegetable, white sauce and traditional pomodoro tomatoe sauce options available. Seating is limited, though I had no trouble finding a couple of counter spots at 12:05 on a Sunday.
I ordered the rigatoni with Vennison Rague (meaty and warm) and my friend ordered the Pomodoro (fresh and tasty).
So good. I'll go back for sure."
Pasta Casalinga,Annie W.,Perfect to the T. I was never a huge fan of pasta until Casalinga and Corvo. Thank goodness this place is open Tuesday - Sunday from 11am to 6pm! I love that it's quick and easy like Corvo. They let you know the selection pasta used for each dish which is helpful. Ordering is quick and simple then you grab a seat by the bar and get to people watch since you are next to Pike's! The wait is never too long since the food comes out immediately always tasting 10/10!! I love this place and always recommend my friends that haven't been. It's such a great lunch to stop at by Pikes & you don't get the crowd.
Pasta Casalinga,Katie C.,"TLDR small menu, small location, big flavor.
Location:
Smallish area that seats about 15 people maximum and about 30 seconds walking into the pike place market entrance with daily dozen donuts.
Food:
Looks like it's a small rotating menu and if I lived around here, I would definitely come to try their new dishes often. I had the from the farm option with boar ragout. Pasta was cooked aldente, sooo perfect and yummy.
Service:
Super fast, even when crowded so just order and a seat will open up when your dish comes."
Pasta Casalinga,Hari K.,"YUM. just YUM! i brought my friends from Boston here and they all agreed with me, it was such amazing pasta. I had something with nuts in it. the pasta texture was unreal! I love that the menu is constantly changing with the seasons it keeps things so fresh."
Pasta Casalinga,Albert L.,"Featuring quality pastas at incredible prices, Pasta Casalinga is perhaps the best bang for the buck I've ever had stateside for Italian food.
Pasta Casalinga focuses on four specific pasta dishes categories such as from the sea, from the garden, from the ocean, and a ""everyday"" choice with each dish costing $11-$13.
When we went, we had dishes like the Garden Beet Pasta w/ burrata, and the hearty Lasagna alla Boscaiola, all of which were not too rich or unnecessarily overwhelming with taste."
Pasta Casalinga,Kevin N.,"A true hidden gem within Pike Place Market. Looking for top-notch pasta without all of the fine-dining hassle? Look no further.
I visited on a Saturday afternoon after seeing this pop up on my yelp home page over and over again. Luckily, despite Pike Place being as busy as it always is on the weekend, there wasn't much of a crowd once I ventured off into the little outlet where this spot is located.
I ordered a ""from the farm,"" which contained some flavorful sausage and mushroom, all enveloped in a fresh pappardelle and olive oil and topped with some salty parmesan. To be honest, I did have pretty high expectations, and I'm glad that they were met upon my first bite. The pasta was cooked perfectly, and the sausage and parmesan provided some nice salt while the mushroom's earthy flavor rounded out the dish well. Being that the sauce was oil-based, it didn't feel too heavy like cream-based pastas tend to be. Also, the portion sizes are deceptively perfect. At first glance, it's a small serving, but when you finish eating it, you'll realize that you'll be just full without feeling bloated - I love that.
The staff were all super nice - one of them even checked on me to make sure I was doing ok, despite there not being any actual waiter service. The are some bar seats in the immediate vicinity, and the sunflowers on the tables brings a smell that actually transports you to the countryside. If no seats are there, there are also some tables in the general area that any Pike Place visitor can sit at. Pro tip: BUS YOUR OWN DISHES - there's a bin across from the register where you put your dirty plates/silverware.
For the quality of pasta here, I'm so used to paying upwards of $20, yet the fact that I paid less than $15 means that the value here is hard to beat if you're looking for quality pasta. I'll be sure to come back to try other menu items."
Pasta Casalinga,Jordan N.,"We decided to stop in this quieter place in like place that had spaces to sit, and time to think about our order. The server seemed like she was rushing us even though there was no line, so that left a little to be desired.
I ordered the From The Ocean ($13) which came with sockeye salmon, zucchini, olives, capers and caserecce noodles. The noodles we're nice and creamy, and the cherry tomatoes were an awesome sweetness to cut through the dish. The olives weren't too strong tasting, and the pasta tasted incredibly fresh. Only complaint is that i didn't get much salmon in my dish. Wished for a better proportion.
I would come here again for a safe choice in pike place because I have been to spots in the market that serve too little for too much. It wasn't anything amazing, but it was a solid choice for the overwhelming options in the market."
Pasta Casalinga,Angie A.,"Wow that was lovely! We live in Seattle but love playing tourists and visiting Pike Place market on a Sunday sometimes. This place was quite hidden from the main touristy part of the market. We found it accidentally. It was so charming and reminding us of Europe so we couldn't help but try it! We had been eating our way through the market at this point and decided to share just 1 dish. We ordered spaghetti with pomodoro sauce. It was soooooo yummy! Perfect amount of food. Pasta cooked a bit too al dente for me but nice and chewy. We didn't know we could add ricotta and or speck to the dish. We will definitely do that next time. It was late lunch but the place was quite busy. Limited seating but we didn't have problems finding space for 2. I was excited and asking them few questions. Staffs were friendly. Dishes came out in good amount of time. Sit at the little corner bar if you enjoy seeing the actions in the kitchen.
Overall a lovely fresh home made pasta restaurant. Menus are simple but delish! We cannot wait to come back!"
Pasta Casalinga,Nam N.,"What a nice hidden gem for authentic pasta dishes. I've frequented Pike Place Market all my life and I've seen Pasta Casalinga tucked away in the southern most part of the market - but for some reason, never felt compelled to go. I think a part of me thought ""it's probably touristy and/or overly expensive.""
Last week - I walked by again but this time - my gut said, ""just try it."" I had the pasta pomodoro and the casalinga lasagna. The pomodoro's sauce was extremely light, the pasta perfectly al dente. It was filling yet, light. Such a simple dish full over flavor.
The Casalinga Lasagna... this was a dream i never knew i wanted to have come true. Im used to the americanized ""loaded with ground beef and processed cheese and smother it in tomato sauce"" type of lasagna. Casalinga gave me a taste of elegance and desire. Smooth and silky pasta, sweet peas and mushrooms for contrast and flavor. The pork sausage so delicatley seasoned for you to actually taste meat and not pure salt. The creamy smoothness of the bechamel sauce paired with the fullness of the grated fresh parmesean - it was a symphony of flavors that was dancing in my mouth.
Few and far between do I eat something that simply pauses time for a brief moment. And makes me feel at home, it was like the moment when Ego (the food critic) took a bit of ratatouille in the movie Ratatouille - and despite me being Asian, i had that same sense of ""takes me back home"" feeling when I eat this lasagna. Its so delicious!"
Pasta Casalinga,Jeff R.,"If you're in the area around Pikes Market and you want amazingly fresh (aka- hand made to order) pasta, then look no further than Pasta Casalinga.
The location is a little harder to find, as you have to venture out of the main halls of the market and find your way into an interior portion of the market buildings.
Once you find it, it might not seem like much, but the humble walk-up counter will provide to be some of the best pasta you have. There is limited seating, so don't be surprised if you have to sit close to someone along the bar, or have to walk a little to find some seating back closer to the main market area.
No matter where you eat it, do yourself a favor and track down this hidden gem and enjoy some fresh pasta."
Pasta Casalinga,Morgan J.,"Great fast yet nice dining option in the market I had no idea about until today! Only 5 options for pasta, but don't worry, there is a seafood, meat, and vegetarian option! It looks like they rotate the menu often, other than the pomodoro and lasagna, which stay the same. And you'll be glad. The radiatore was good but the lasagna was great. There is plenty of counter seating or if you have a larger group you can take them to tables down one level to seating there. You order at the counter. They serve alcohol. So cute!"
Pasta Casalinga,Willy M.,"Came by for lunch with a few buds, one of them is a finicky eater, told him to suck it up and deal with it and branch out a little, it's pasta for crying out loud!
Anyways, this pasta spot is located inside Pike Place Market, it's around the corner from DeLaurenti, it's where Honest Biscuits used to be, near the atrium entrance.
Friendly greetings as we walked up, they have about 4-6 pastas available, it's a rotating menu so don't fall in love with it as it can be more of a hit & run depending on seasonal ingredients.
I decided to choose the ""From the Ocean"" option which was sable fish with paccheri pasta, red peppers, olives, capers and this olive oil sauce. It was very good! The paccheri pasta was great, love large tube pasta! I rarely think of adding fish to pasta, I did once add canned tuna to mac & cheese when I was in college. The sable fish in this dish was tasty, went well with all the other ingredients and overall very delicious!
There are a few other options like a sausage pasta dish, a vegetarian pasta dish and their popular lasagna. I think Ill try that next time.
Portions aren't large nor small, it's actually quite perfect, we left comfortably full and satisfied. Prices are about $10 -$13 depending on which pasta dish you choose. Staff is friendly, everything is cooked to order, fresh pasta for each dish, there's stools and a ledge for you to eat at but just around the corner from them, there are community tables you can sit at, we just took our dishes down there to eat. It's no major physical feat to return your bowl back to their bins, so be sure to do that.
We all enjoyed our pasta dishes, even the finicky eater friend wants to come back again, you're welcome bud!
Great pasta place, definitely coming back again!"
Pasta Casalinga,Marissa S.,"This has to be my new favorite restaurant currently. Some of the best pasta I've had in my life and it is so ridiculously affordable, you're losing money not buying it! I will be back. And back again. A lot."
Pasta Casalinga,Katie K.,"As a pasta aficionado, I'm not easily impressed. I was eager to try Pasta Casalinga after reading ""lunch only, made fresh daily, while supplies last"" on their website. We were greeted with big smiles from the staff. My two friends and I each ordered a separate meal and all tasted a bite of one another's. I can confidently say, you won't find a bad thing on the menu. I'm already planning my next trip. It is a must go if you're in the market area."
Due’ Cucina Italiana,Monica L.,"I'm not a pasta lover whatsoever. I eat pasta maybe once or twice a year. But I about licked my plate and my friend's plate. Holy moly. I couldn't get enough of my lasagna and her campanelle.
The staff is super friendly too. You pick up your food, grab your own water, and bus your own table. You have to go up to the counter to order too. There's no waiter but nobody cares because the pasta is out of this world.
It's too bad I don't live right above the building. I'm now a total convert."
Due’ Cucina Italiana,Jessica C.,"Great little pasta place. The price was good. The pasta was fresh.
They do a build your own style ordering. You pick a sauce and a pasta
Got the mushroom and white truffle sauce with fettuccine. I kinda wish I got it with the recommended pasta or was a bit wavy and curled which held the sauce much better than flat fettuccine noodles BUT it was much more al dente than the fettuccine. And I like my pasta soft.
Added the sausage to it but it wasn't too much of a difference. The sauce was so flavorful didn't need the meat."
Due’ Cucina Italiana,Yash D.,"Great fresh pasta and choice of sauces. It was pretty laid back on a Friday night. Lots of vegetarian options. Don't forget to:
1. Clean up after you leave.
2. Order bread with your pasta dish."
Due’ Cucina Italiana,Marie B.,"I love pasta and have been to just about every Italian spot in Seattle. Handmade pasta, I'm there! Pasta in a casual setting, even better! Most often though, I don't have access to the likes of Il Corvo, Pasta Casalinga, G.H. Pasta, Ristorante Machiavelli, Tavolata, or La Vita e Bella because I currently don't work in Seattle.
However, the very first Yelper I ever met is credited for the recommendation to Due' Cucina Italiana *Bryan K* Clearly, I had been under a rock and late to the pasta bowl party at this popular Capitol Hill/Broadway spot. I've interacted with the two brothers than run DCI, great charismatic business owners. Brilliant concept and business hours until 2200! Great counter staff and efficient kitchen crew. A variety of seating are available whether dining solo, pairs or larger groups. Just remember to kindly bus your table at the end!
My first visit was back in December 2018 (been open since October 2016!) and have been back so many times that honestly I've lost count. This is a long overdue Yelp review as I just had a custom pasta bowl for dunch/linner hours ago (1/27/20).
Assorted fresh pasta that's crafted on site. Your pasta bowl is customized by selecting type of pasta, sauce, and other ingredients from the giant wall signage. Order and pay at the counter, then find a place to sit if dining onsite. There's also brisk takeout and delivery traffic.
In about 15-20 minutes your name is called or check the status on the order monitor. I like to admire my pasta bowl and then dig in while nice and hot. Feeling raveneous, one can easily polish off a bowl. Most often, I have tasty leftovers for another meal.
Another item I've had often (but not today) is their delicious tiramisu. Enough to share, or not!
So thank you Bryan K, Due' Cucina Italiana has become one of my regular spots.
High quality, delicious, affordable, satisfying, highly recommended!"
Due’ Cucina Italiana,Cristina G.,"I have ordered this twice to be delivered to my office using uber eats. This is the best italian pasta I have eaten in Seattle with the exception of Barolo. The pasta is definitely made freshly from scratch and cooked perfectly al dente chewy.
My favorite dish is the mushroom and truffle oil pasta The first time, i went with another reviewer's suggestion and added pork. I decided I liked it better without pork since pork was flavorful but a little greasy.
Last time I ordered a pasta with another type of ragu and it was also great but needing cheese. Make sure you request extra cheese if you order this pasta.
I would pass on ordering any of the breads."
Due’ Cucina Italiana,Julia L.,"Had a lovely lunch here recently! The place is modern, clean, well lit (large windows) with plenty of open seating. Remember to seat yourself & bus your own table. My group tried a variety of the sauces...
- traditional bolognese: rich, hearty, filling
- cacio & pepe: the cheese flavor was very sharp and strong, delicious but a bit too much for me
- amatriciana: lots of tomato flavors + smokey, savory goodness in the form of guanciale (cured pork cheek)
- mushroom & white truffle oil: creamy, thick, but not too heavy. Wonder, well balanced flavors between the mushroom and truffle oil (personal favorite out of the 4 sauces)
The pastas were all fresh and perfectly al dente (firm, chewy). Personally enjoyed the rigatoni and ca campanelle best. Would recommend and come back again!"
Due’ Cucina Italiana,Pauli D.,"Fresh pasta + mushroom sauce =
----
Every time I go to @duecucina I become more and more of a fan. It's a place that has definitely grown on me. The pastas are light, more my style for lunch, and very very fresh!
----
My favorite at the moment would be the mushroom sauce. Simple and yet the umami really shines through. What do you get here?"
Due’ Cucina Italiana,Edward A.,"Friendly staff, in a way. I was told the order line starts near the entrance. I thought i had to order at the food pickup area. Oops.
I had eggplant parmesan. Pretty tasty little appetizer dish. My wife had the only pasta dish that was rated high on the al dente-ish. Those noodles were rather undercooked. Felt like i was eating them raw. But i guess thats what it is by definition? I can definitely see the appeal."
Due’ Cucina Italiana,Yvonne Yiyao X.,"Can't believe it took me so long to find this place. Friendly service. Reasonably priced. Food is fast and fresh. Delicious sauce. Pasta is al dente. I loved both pasta dishes and the tiramisu. I see their take out orders coming out rapidly. The store is not super busy or overwhelming. The owner actually cares about his business and was cleaning up here and there. The kitchen is bright and clean - always a good thing to be able to see the kitchen.
Four stars but only because of my love to Il Corvo. This is a place I'll certainly come back soon."
Due’ Cucina Italiana,Derek H.,"AMBIANCE
I'm a huge fan of white tile on white grout walls because it really brightens up the place. The servers are super friendly and nice. Food came out in less than ten minutes. It's cool to see all the pasta being made behind the counter. The place is really clean.
FOOD
We went with the Mushroom and White Truffle Oil with Pork Sausage and the Traditional Bolognese both with their recommended pastas. You could definitely taste the freshness of the pasta (not that I had any doubt because they literally make it behind the counter). The noodles had a great bounce, while still remaining a perfect al dente.
The sauces were great, but honestly just didn't fit my preferred palette. Completely a personal thing. The wine hints in the bolognese were too pronounced for my liking. I prefer a meatier and drier bolognese. It was hard to taste the truffle in the other dish. Then again it's $13, you can't expect much. I would have preferred more cream, but again, it's just personal preference!
OVERALL
Great vibe, I love being able to choose different sauces and noodles. I'd come back if I was in the area for a different dish."
Due’ Cucina Italiana,Brianna F.,"We came here on a Thursday evening for a double date to celebrate a couple birthdays and it was packed! Due Cucina Italiana is an order-upon-entry, seat-yourself, and bus-your-own-table establishment. Luckily our friends had arrived earlier than us and were able to snag a table.
The ordering steps are as follows: choose a sauce, choose a pasta, order add-ons or drinks if wanted, sit and watch the screen until your order is ready.
Holy guacamole this place is good! Although the rest of my party ordered the bolognese ragu, I decided on the mushroom and white truffle oil sauce with campanelle pasta and pork sausage. The wait for our food was about 15 minutes, but the food is freshly prepared after your order is placed. The portions are extremely generous for the price, and it's very obvious that the pasta is fresh and perfectly al dente.
I will definitely be back to try the other sauce and pasta options. AND DESSERTS! ;)"
Due’ Cucina Italiana,Stanley T.,"Absolutely wonderful. I am so glad I came here on my Seattle trip.
FOOD
The pasta was absolutely DELICIOUS and made FRESH. My friends and I ordered 3 pasta bowls. I don't remember the pasta noodles itself but I remember ordering the Traditional Bolognese, Kale Pesto, and Mushroom & White Truffle Oil. Let me just say, the Mushroom & White Truffle was splendid and this is coming from a person that HATES mushrooms. The truffle oil wasn't overbearing and the shiitake mushrooms was an excellent compliment to the overall dish due to the umami flavor. The Bolognese came second, it was decadent but not too heavy. The Kale Pesto came in last, it was good but not my cup of tea. It had a very earthy flavor that some of you may like.
SERVICE
Exceptional service. The two girls that were working on 1/18/2020 around 7pm were extremely delightful. I loved their recommendations of which pasta went with which sauce.
RESTAURANT
Cool garden wall. Seating may be limited depending on the time. We went during dinner and it was a struggle finding seating but we eventually found seats.
CLEANLINESS
Clean. Seattle has a thing were you take the plates and utensils to the cart yourself.
PARKING
There is street parking but I walked to the restaurant."
Due’ Cucina Italiana,Liz J.,"Manager reached out to resolve past order issue, but Postmates wouldn't resolve it. Not to worry, we tried them again through Doordash with no issue.
Ordered 3 pasta dishes (Bolognese, mushroom truffle, Amatriciana). They were all amazing, and we found ourselves sad when we realized we ate our dinner too quickly. Definitely would recommend if you have a pasta craving."
Due’ Cucina Italiana,Melody Y.,"Oh my goodness the food is absolutely incredible here! The pasta is fresh, cooked to al dante perfection, and tasted amazing. I love how they offer sublime quality Italian dishes in a casual environment.
Being from Vancouver, I never thought there'd be a place like this. Wanting Italian food always means paying significantly more for a fine dining experience. Not only is Due Cucina super casual, but the prices are also affordable as well. I highly recommend adding a poached egg to your pasta! Elevates the experience to a whole other level."
Due’ Cucina Italiana,Mohit N.,"Went with a friend for dinner and ordered the Kale Pesto pasta and the Bean Ragout as our vegetarian options. I had never had beans with pasta before, but this place somehow made it work really well. The Kale Pesto, however, was definitely our favorite. Can't wait to try the mushroom & white truffle oil pasta next time!"
Due’ Cucina Italiana,Jen L.,"My biggest complaint is that our pastas were NOT hot. It was a warm, but not close to hot! Lasagna was hot. We were waiting at the counter before they even called my name since I saw we were next up.
- Mushroom and white truffle with added pork sausage. This was our favorite. My sister's bowl had more sauce than ours, which I think is better as ours was a bit dry. What's with the inconsistency?
-Smoked salmon spaghetti: as you can see from my photo we had very little salmon compared to other customers' photos and the restaurant website's photos. WTH?! It was mostly noodles with a few piece of salmon and a pile of greens. Totally not what everyone else's pics look like.
- Lasagna Bolognese: I've definitely had better. Would probably choose the regular bolognese pasta over this.
- bell pepper bruschetta: too salty, but a nice change from a regular caprese
- tiramisu: delicious!
Pros: fresh pastas are cooked to perfection. Price is on point.
They do not take reservations. You order at the cashier, and then wait for them to call your name. It's really loud inside so there's board that tells you when they are ready for you to come up to the counter to get your food to carry back to your table. And the bowls/plates are heavy. You have to get your own water in the back. Also you are required to bus your own table. So what exactly did I add a tip for? I guess I should have read the other reviews. Maybe that's how they keep their prices reasonable. I was so excited to come here after being in Italy 1 month ago, and chose this restaurant for a night out with friends. With the inconsistency of salmon portion (and mushroom sauce), and failure of the proper temp of the pasta, I feel disappointed."
Due’ Cucina Italiana,Artemiy B.,"My meals look was awful and there is nothing special in its taste too, I'm upset
I'm gonna add some pics how their food supposed to look and how it looks in real life"
Due’ Cucina Italiana,Visesha K.,"Surprisingly, out of everything we ate on our short trip to Seattle, this was one of the best. I really enjoyed how you could choose your own sauce and type of pasta, which is made fresh in front of your very eyes. I also liked that the sauces had a lot of vegetarian options, and there was overall a lot of good variety. The only downside is that you do have to go pick up your food from the back when it's ready and bus your tables at the end, so if you are looking for a fancy, sit-down restaurant, this is not the place. However, as a couple looking for an affordable Italian restaurant, this was the perfect spot for dinner."
Due’ Cucina Italiana,Sachi E.,"I'm not a huge restaurant pasta eater because I'd rather make my own at home. My friend flew from NY to visit and wanted to try this place, so we went. It's open seating so be prepared to sit with strangers and bus your own table. The service was one of the worst I've had - very short, condescending when I asked about the pasta and when I asked for a side of sausage was told ""no"" with an attitude. The actual pasta was tasty, but nothing outstanding or special. Will not be back to this place and wouldn't recommend this place over any other pasta place in Seattle."
Due’ Cucina Italiana,chara c.,"Disappointing. The pasta dough is homemade but machine-worked and the gluten is clearly not worked long enough because it has no chew or ""bite"" to it. My plate of pasta was also undercooked and tough. The sauces were mostly good, except the Amatriciana was a too salty and way too much cheese it was overpowering. It was more casual than expected but that was just fine, as orders were at the front and you picked up your own food. Came out pretty quickly and it wasnt too busy during weekday lunch."
Aglio e Olio,Julia A.,"My favorite cuisine is Italian food so my husband and I like to venture out to try all the Italian restaurants there are in Seattle. This restaurant is in a really hidden location (it's the right most business in the plaza) and there's no well lit/big sign at all in the front to help you locate the restaurant as you drive here. But note that the small parking lot IS available to park at when you eat here!
We ordered the Bruschetta to start - lovely! It contained lots of tomatoes so that was a very pleasant start. For dinner, I ordered the Spaghetti Carbonara and my husband ordered the Lasagna. When you order your entrees....order one between two people. Don't say I didn't warn you!! The portion size is GINORMOUS (see pics) and you definitely want to leave room for dessert. Unless you want lots of leftovers (I mean that is not a bad thing), then split an entree. :P The actual entrees were absolutely DELICIOUS. For dessert, we ordered the Canoli - light and YUMMY!! We were disappointed there wasn't Panna Cotta on the dessert menu but we got over that pretty quickly. :P
Highly recommend trying this restaurant! It's a hidden gem. :)"
Aglio e Olio,Cindy I.,"Wish it had nicer atmosphere in the restaurant but it's full of old school fluorescent lights dimmed with decorative covers. So we took the food to go. The chicken Marsala was more bland than we like. We both felt the chicken Parmesan was very good and would go back for that again. Meatballs and spaghetti was a meal we would order again too.
Don't forget the garlic knots are great!"
Aglio e Olio,Megha B.,"This is one of my favorite hole in the wall restaurant in Seattle.
The food is very authentic and amazing. I love the garlic knots, spaghetti aglio e olio, harvest gnocchi and the pizza. The house red is usually pretty decent.
I like the server and manager at this restaurant, they are both really friendly and it's always a great time dining here.
I will continue eating here!"
Aglio e Olio,Mindful M.,"Absolute hidden gem. Every time we come I'm stunned at how good the food is for the price, and how laid back it is! Non-pretentious, incredible homemade and authentic food, cozy atmosphere. I'm always shocked this place isn't packed any time we come in, but on the rare occasion it is they're always happy to suggest takeout which is just as nice."
Aglio e Olio,Clay B.,"What a wonderful place to sit and have delicious homemade Italian food, we were waited on by the chef.
She makes everything in house and wonderful! Higher recommend the Lamb Ragout sandwich, the lunch menu is small, but they have a much larger menu for dinner that starts at 4pm. Lunch is from 11:am- 2:00pm, get there early as it is a small restaurant but very nice."
Aglio e Olio,Kathy A.,"I definitely found my new favorite Italian restaurant in Seattle! This place is perfect. You would never notice it from the street view and when you walk in you're immediately thinking ""wait? really? this place does good italian food?"" It is a quintessential hole in the wall restaurant without any bells and whistles on ambiance but the food and service far exceed expectations! Portions are large and the price points are hard to beat. The farro salad is massive and has huge chunks of goat cheese. Quite tasty! The arancini are hearty and topped with plenty of tomato sauce. The harvest gnocchi was divine! Rich, cheesy but still a nice light pasta dish. Our server was lovely as well and the food came out rather quick! I can't wait to return!"
Aglio e Olio,Jennifer T.,"Came here last Friday with a friend and we indulged in the ""Family Style"" meal, where you choose what you pay (suggested $20-50 pp) and the chef curates a multi-course dinner for the table. Per our server's recommendation, we did $35 to bring us from appetizer to dessert, and this was no joke best $35 I've ever spent at a restaurant!! The quantity and quality of food served here would have easily been $60+ pp at other restaurants. So happy I've found this hidden gem!! Would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for great value, authentic Italian comfort food.
More on the food:
- Appetizer (5/5...peep my photo to see the full spread!!): A few of my favorites were the caesar salad w/ crab meat, steamed clams in white wine, deep fried gnocchi, tomatoes & burrata, and toasted baguette w/ this amaaazing pistachio spread. I probably could've been full off just the first course! But of course, I paced myself in anticipation for the other dishes... :)
- Pesto tortellini with goat cheese and sun dried tomatoes (5/5): This was easily the most decadent and well-made tortellini I've ever had! The pasta itself had the perfect amount of bite/chewiness, the pesto was so fresh/aromatic, and the creamy goat cheese + the sweet-tartness of the sun-dried tomato made every bite taste like a little piece of heaven. I'm typically not blown away by tortellini but this dish packed so much flavor!
- Steak w/ roasted asparagus (4/5): The steak cut like butter and the asparagus was perfectly roasted and seasoned...it was a simple dish but was cooked really well and complemented the bold flavors in our other courses. Dessert:
- Cheesecake w/ chocolate salami (4/5): Loved how the cheesecake was so fluffy/light! Also enjoyed nibbling on the salami-shaped dark chocolates pieces with walnuts.
Our server was super helpful and friendly -- he consistently went out of his way to make sure we were enjoying our food and our water cups were never empty. The restaurant itself is modestly sized and modestly decorated...the ambiance is nothing to write home about, but the incredible food, service, and value made Aglio E Olio a 5/5 experience for me!"
Aglio e Olio,Nikhil T.,This is a hidden gem. One of the handful places in Seattle that can serve a delicious main course under $20. We have been here twice and both times found the food to be delicious and the portion sizes large (you're guaranteed to have leftovers). The olive oil and fresh bread is heavenly. The pesto pasta is great as well. The music and decor is quirky Italian. The server is fantastic to talk to.
Aglio e Olio,Jon H.,"So far this is my favorite Italian place in the city. The bruschetta is delicious, as is the parm and practically anything you can order!
My advice: come early in the day before the evening rush or call in a reservation, the restaurant is very small and fills up quickly (literally maybe 5 or 6 tables)"
Aglio e Olio,Travis G.,"I am so happy to be so close to this place! There are a ton of great items on the menu, but I keep going back to the strip steak with the gorgonzola gnocchi. So good and a great price. Also, the bruschetta is a standout. But really everything I've had is good - we've tried nearly every item on the menu."
Aglio e Olio,Joe S.,"Amazing. From the outside it doesnt look like much, but the food here is tied for my favorite Italian place. The staff is very personable and welcoming.
My go-to is the 4 cheese pasta, I don't know if I would consider it my favorite dish ever, but as the time I'm writing this, I'm having a hard time thinking of anything that I could definitively say tops it."
Aglio e Olio,Amanda E.,The best italian food ever! Also the best service I can get on this new year day! I had the seafood rigatoni with a lemon zest alfredo sauce. Mighty delicious!
Aglio e Olio,Jeff B.,"4.5 stars.
What a surprise. Our son wanted to have birthday dinner here, so the five of us went on a Saturday evening.
FOOD: 4.5 stars. We had $35 per person dinner, leaving the chef to decide the contents. This included for the vegan among us. Excellent value. Several appetizers (green salad, cold cuts, olives, mozzarella, bruschetta, artichokes, etc), pasta meat dish, lamb chops (and equivalents for the vegan). Followed by dessert. The bday boy received a free tiramisu - heavenly; the rest of us had chocolate gelato with fruit - excellent!
We also had a carafe of house red wine from Montepulciano.
SERVICE: 5.0 stars. The gentleman and lady servers worked hard to ensure we were very satisfied.
AMBIANCE: 4.0 stars. Nicely done, attractive (yet simple) interior.
TIP: Make reservations, at least for a Sat evening. They were fully booked the evening we dined. Quite a few people came in for take-out."
Aglio e Olio,Jim P.,"Oh My!
Came for lunch, and if you blink you may drive right past this place. Nothing fancy about the building or the interior for that matter (never mind the greasy floors) but man they can put out some dang nice foods.
We had the porchetta sandwich, the mortadella sandwich, rigatoni bowl, and an alfredo bowl (with porchetta). The sandwiches are huge, great bread, fillings super hot and plentiful. I also love the gardenia mix.
The pastas come with ceasar salad and I garlic knot that you wish you had about a dozen more of.
Prices are very reasonable, now if I could only convince them to open a place in West Seattle my live would be complete."
Aglio e Olio,S S.,"This place is a gem. The staff is super friendly and helpful. The food is among the best Italian in the city. I don't come here as often as I would like because, well, weight. I always eat waaaayyyyy too much when I'm here. The hole in the wall aspect is nice and cozy, but I do wish they had an upmarket version as well so I could come here as a night out.
Also, I wish they would deliver with someone other than Bite Squad."
Aglio e Olio,Zelda H.,"The food is wonderful. Fresh pasta, good sauces, and good wine.
Service is not as good as it used to be. Pizza is soggy. Giving it 4 stars because in general, the food is top-notch."
Aglio e Olio,Ryan T.,"I'm so glad I found this place. It's small, but the ambiance and homemade food make for one of the best Italian restaurants I've been to. Our server had excellent recommendations for food, including gluten free and pescatarian and gluten free options. In fact for gluten free options, many things on the menu including deep fried dishes and pasta, can be made without wheat to perfection.
Get a reservation or go early!"
Aglio e Olio,Rahul D.,"Against my selfish desire to keep this place secret, I'm writing a public review of this place.
I have been here several times with varying party sizes and types (2, 4, 10, some vegetarians, some pescatarians, typical omnivores, etc.), for my birthday, parents' birthday, going-away parties, date nights, etc.
I have had the family-style serving every time (35 for antipasti, pasta, meat, and dessert!!). The staff is excellent at accommodating dietary restrictions that vary throughout the party, and their choices always satisfy.
The quality is always excellent, the service is always great, the drinks are always smooth and well-priced, and the value is always incredible.
I hope you all get to enjoy this small restaurant, be sure to reserve ahead of time due to limited seating."
Aglio e Olio,AJ A.,"Had the mortadella and fried egg sandwich for lunch. DELICIOUS!
Quaint, lots of personality. Hidden away in the back of a tiny collection of ground floor shops. It's actually around the corner and in back."
Aglio e Olio,Kevin L.,"This is my hands-down favorite Italian restaurant in Seattle. I live in Capitol Hill and the Italian places are nice, but they're a bit upscale and hit or miss as they try out the hottest and hippest ingredients on the market.
Aglio e Olio, however, I found randomly when I decided I needed a bite to eat and was in the area. It's a small intimate restaurant and I was thinking: ""Sigh, whatever. At least I can just get pasta or something.""
Wow. This place has hands down my favorite meatballs I've ever had in my entire life. They're huge, and they taste AMAZING. I've been going back more frequently now, and I also have to recommend the Calamari. It's not deep-fried, it's not crispy, but instead it's this AMAZING pan-seared quality. Please, please, please do yourself a favor and try the Calamari. Ridiculously good!
Anyways. I didn't realize I was coming into a wonderful small family-style and family-tasting Italian restaurant until I tasted the food, and at that point I realized I was in a good place.
I love you, Aglio e Olio! I hope you stay here for a very long time."
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,Tayler H.,"Bizzaros is a kooky and perfect little Italian hole-in-the-wall! I 10/10 recommend eating here. It's easy to access right off the I-5 freeway, and is in a very cute and ""old"" restaurant row.
The restaurant itself is very homey, with ""bizzare"" decor. Loved the romantic/fun lighting. Our waitress was very nice.
The food itself was fresh and different than what I've had before. We really enjoyed our dinner here!"
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,Jessica M.,"The food didn't match the hype for us, but the service was exceptional.
3 stars for the food and 5 for the service so we'll leave it a 4 overall.
Came here on a Monday night just before the prime dinner rush, and thankfully we did. This place was fulllll. Even with two large parties, our server gave us plenty of attention and was so sweet. This restaurant has parking right in front, although only a handful of spots, and has the quirkiest decor.
We ordered the meatballs and spaghetti with starter salad, elk bolognese with onion soup, and the fainting goat gelato for dessert.
The pasta itself was just ok - I really wished I had liked it more given all the raving reviews. I'm tempted to come back here to try some of the other pasta dishes though."
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,Linda L.,"Came here for dinner and the experience absolutely blew my mind. The environment is quirky and unique, and the service is excellent. The food though - - WOW. We had the arancini to start. The sauce around the arancini was some of the best that I have ever tasted. We also tried the seasonal pumpkin gnocchi with Italian sausage, as well as the wild mushroom parapadelle. Both were very rich, with superb flavor. I can't wait to go back to try the wild elk bolognese, which is their most popular dish. They serve wine casual Italian style, out of rocks glasses.
If you come after 5:30 you can expect a wait. Definitely will be a wait if you come after 6"
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,Patrick C.,"This is the cutest cafe with lots of little bits and baubles everywhere. The place is always busy and usually requires a wait. After a handful of visits, I think I'm done with Bizzarros cafe. The food quality for the price point just isn't up to snuff. I recently ordered some cacio e peppe - and it was like eating a giant bowl of bland noddles. I would guess that to make that dish a star you need super fresh and spicy pepper along with noodles cooked to perfection. Nope. I think for the money Zouave over on 65th is much, and less insanely crowded."
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,Mahsa S.,the restaurant has a great atmosphere with eclectic decor. It's fairly small so expect a long wait. The food was good but a bit expensive for just simple marinara pasta and cheese. The complimentary bread was delicious though
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,Sandra G.,Loved the unique atmosphere. Felt very cozy. Great food and drinks. A must when in Seattle.
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,Regina X.,"Snap pea carbonara had the right flavors with the heavy cheesiness cut by the crispy snap peas and pancetta. The linguini, however, was overcooked and a sad lump hard to separate. For appetizer, the Arancini rice balls were heavy and cheesy but made for a nicely textured dish. Love the outlandish decor and would be back for more pasta."
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,Nishita K.,Highly recommend the tiramisu! Best I have had in a long time. Aranciji was okay. The pastas were delicious. The proportions were great. I had the seasonal pasta 'bombastica'. It was white wine based not too acidic. Very light and flavorful. The elk pasta was hearty and very flavoful. I thought I wouldn't like it because it's elk meat but I would definitely get it for myself next time. Forest floor frenzy as well as the chicken main course we're delicious. Service was great! The servers were very cheerful and gave some nice recommendations and answered our questions. They served us some bread while we waited for our food. We waited for about 30/35 mins on a Friday night to get a table for 4.
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,SonyA C.,"This is my favorite Italian place in Seattle. It has a cozy and interesting ambiance and the food is phenomenal. I especially love the bread and the seasonal dishes. Each entree comes with a fresh salad, with optional upgrade to Caesar salad, spinach salad, or soup. I honestly liked the starter salad the best.
All our dishes felt very high quality. They were well made and their ingredients seemed especially good. My favorite dish was the forest floor frenzy and it's assortment of mushrooms. So tasty.
In conclusion, this would be a great place for a date night. Tasty food, cozy ambiance, unusual decor, and not too loud to have conversation. Watch out though, it's popular and if you go at prime dinner time, you'll need to wait."
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,Alex O.,"I don't like it. The bread was just not tasty and it felt old & stale. I got the eggplant Parmesan fritters for the appetizer. It was inconsistent. Sometimes it was spicy and sometimes it wasn't. It also felt like an amateur cooked it. Cut slices of eggplant, deep fry it, slather tomato sauce and cheese. Serve. Felt very fast food. The forest floor is basically mushroom sauce and pasta. If you love mushrooms then get this. Otherwise, it has an overwhelming amount of fungi. The sugar snap carbonara was a huge disappointment. Trust me the pasta is not made in house and if it is...it sure doesn't taste like it. It felt over cooked and soggy and reminded me of ramen noodles. Also, the sauce is bland. The reason why people like it is because the bacon and peas have a lot of flavor.
The garlic soup is extra buttery and has cloves of garlic. It was way too extreme for me.
Dessert sucked!! Honestly, if they bought the dessert from an outside source it would have probably tasted better."
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,Jessica T.,"My family and I were on vacation in Seattle and stopped here for dinner. We all loved the look and feel of the place. Atmosphere is definitely bizzarro.
There was no wait time for a table of 4/weeknight.
Starter salad had a mild, sweet dressing that even our pickiest teenager enjoyed.
Food was really good. Forest Floor Frenzy was creamy and mushroomy heaven.
Lasagna- good
Meatballs-great
Antipasta plate-great
What else about this place? The bathrooms. Weird recording playing in one of them with paintings of big eyed children. Creepy and intriguing."
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,Ray M.,"This spot is a must for locals and visitors. It is quintessential Seattle in all the right ways.
I love this spot because it is as fun as it is tasty. And it is very fun... and very tasty. So much eye candy and everything on the menu is ridiculously good.
If you haven't been to Bizzarro, then I recommend you go. And if you are planning to go to Bizzarro, then I HIGHLY RECOMMEND the lasagna - you're welcome :) Enjoy"
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,Jacob H.,"I have been to Bizzarro countless times and there is always something new to see on the walls or ceiling. They definitely have the classic Italian theme going for them, which is matched by exquisite Italian food. They have some of the best dishes in Seattle, with a good mixture of light and heavy dishes that are sure to make everyone happy. The staff is wonderful, knowledgeable, and attentive, but not overly attentive.
They only downside is they do not take reservations. But there are several spots around where you can go to grab a drink while your table is prepared.
If you are looking for THE Italian dinning experience in Seattle, this is your spot!"
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,Nita L.,"Most aptly named, this place is a Bizarre combination of Romantic yet Eclectic.
Ambience:
You have candle lit tables and an assortment of chandeliers, you also have skeletal brides seated on a carriage hanging off the ceiling. (Not kidding)
Food:
We had the Elk Bolognese: My first time tasting Elk, and for those who are afraid to try it, this tastes very similar to lamb. The pasta and elk were both fantastic. If you are familiar with the Pakistani/Indian dish called ""Kheema"", this was like having Elk Kheema over pasta. Delicious!
We also had the ""I gnocchi what you did last summer"", delicious creamy gnocchi. Those who like blue cheese will love this. It is cooked in a walnut and blue cheese based sauce.
We ended the meal with the Tiramisu for dessert. It was Humungous and delightful to the last bite.
Service & Cost:
The servers are friendly and service is quick. The prices here are not too terrible, cost us ~70 (not including tip) for two people- we had a carafe of wine, two entrees and dessert. Pretty decent for the food & ambience!
I've read other reviews complaining about the wait time, but I went on a Tuesday evening so I did not face this issue. Definitely a fantasic choice for your dose of Italian, Romance and crazy! Ill be back for sure."
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,Stacey P.,"Full disclosure - I came here after a full day of drinking at the Scotch and Beer Festival followed by a couple hours at a bar. What I'm saying is this is my perception drunk.
My friends really wanted to take me and another friend here and I'll admit I was a little hesitant. The word ""Bizarro"" filled my head with a clown and circus theme, for some reason (drunk), and I didn't want to deal with clowns. There were no clowns.
I recall there being a wait but we stood outside where there was plenty of room to talk and it was nice. There wasn't any room inside to wait. Once inside they seated us in the back corner. I didn't feel too crowded and took in the assortment of stuff that was everywhere. While no rhyme or reason seemed to be had it reminded me of having dinner in one of those antique stores you find in a small town surrounded by stuff in every direction.
The bread was good - thick and chewy. The olive oil was ok, the balsamic vinegar was on the spot. Their lasagna was unremarkable to me. It was noodly goodness with heavy marinara and...I don't recall the cheese. I mean, I'm sure there was cheese because lasagna has cheese but it didn't pierce my drunken haze. My friend had this bolognese dish that was delightful - salty, flavorful, great noodles, fantastic meat. I recall taking full advantage of her permitting me to eat it and then giving my leftover lasagna for them to take home.
The service was utilitarian. They weren't overly talkative, friendly, or engaging. We came in late and I imagine they were tired. It seemed like lots of different people came to drop off and pick up dishes. Our waitress became a little cross with us as I wasn't the only one inebriated and our slow pace at ordering combined with not being as specific as she needed made her irritated. I can't blame her.
We all Ubered home after. It was nice, different, and a change of pace."
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,Chong H.,Best chicken Marsala this side of the Mississippi!
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,Samantha O.,"We had someone recommend this place to us, and overall I did enjoy this restaurant. I probably wouldn't hurry to return, but if I really wanted Italian food (not generally my favorite cuisine so this doesn't happen often) then I'd come back. We came here at about 7:30 pm on a Sunday evening, and the two of us were seated right away. The service was a little slow at first but it did pick up after we placed our entree orders. There was a bit of a mix up with our appetizer order, but we ended up enjoying the arancini (the one that was accidentally brought to us- we were not charged for this) FAR more than the bruschetta we ordered.
Just to get this over with: their version of bruschetta was honestly one of the worst things I've ever eaten. This sounds like I'm being dramatic, I know, but goodness what an odd flavor combination. I would not call myself picky and I'm able to eat pretty much anything people put on my plate, but this... was a no-go for me. We both felt bad about the mix up so we tried to force ourselves to eat more of the bruschetta but it was just so bad that I couldn't. Weird flavors, way, WAY too sweet for an appetizer. The only positive part of this dish was the bread it was on, but it was ruined by the sickly sweet reduction and the horrendous gorgonzola. People on yelp seem to really enjoy it, but I'm just here to tell you- it won't be for everyone. It's unfortunate because I feel like they could do a classic savory bruschetta beautifully, but I understand wanting to do something more unique, I guess.
The arancini was quite good, on the other hand. This was the appetizer that was mistakenly served to us (just to be clear, we pointed this out to our waiter and he asked if we just wanted to keep it- we didn't just dive in). Honestly, even though we felt bad about the mix up, we were glad it happened because of the whole bruschetta situation. This made up for the bruschetta. Our waiter described them as fried balls of risotto with fontina cheese and saffron. The marinara it was served on had a lovely, light smokey flavor. I'd order this one again.
The complimentary focaccia comes with olive oil and balsamic to dip it in. Every aspect of this was delicious. The olive oil tasted amazing. You could even do without an appetizer if you wanted to because of this amazing bread.
For my entree I chose the Sicilian pesto, which was in the seasonal section of the menu. At first I wasn't too impressed flavor wise, but then when I mixed the dish up a bit more the flavors were dispersed much more evenly. I ate the leftovers the next day and it was better after the flavors melded together more. Probably wouldn't order this one again due to how dull it was despite the exciting description. The entrees come with a starter salad, but you can substitute for another type of salad or soup for $4. I got the caesar salad. I loved it. It was beautiful- and they put anchovies on it which I personally enjoy. (Our waiter asked me if the anchovies were okay with me, so if you don't want them then you're able to omit them.) My boyfriend got the started salad, which he said was ""not that great."" The $4 sounds crazy, but the caesar salad I got was probably three times the size of what my boyfriend got. Also if you love caesar salad like I do then it's worth a try in my opinion.
For his entree he ordered the margarita and added the meaty bolognese. The rolled pasta was beautiful. The flavors were simple and tasty.
He doesn't like coffee flavored things or coffee in general, and I somehow persuaded him to try the tiramisu. He actually enjoyed it! The coffee flavor wasn't too strong for him, which he was worried about. I loved everything about the tiramisu and would definitely order this dessert again.
The service was a bit slow at first, like I mentioned earlier. But after we ordered everything was pretty efficient. Our waiter was really nice and didn't check on us too much or too little. The only thing that I thought was a little annoying was their ""no phone"" policy. I mean. I get it. You want to be the place where people talk to each other instead of looking at a screen the entire time. You don't want people talking loudly on their phones, ignoring the wait-staff because they're on their phones, or doing some other annoying crap like that. Understandable. I just find policies like this to be pretentious and try-hard. Just my opinion."
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,Milton F.,"Cozy little Italian restaurant not far from Green Lake. Came here based on the yelp ratings and pictures of the decor.
I ordered the Margarita Pasta with meat sauce which was pretty good. Not sure what kind of pasta they used as I had never seen it before, but the baked melted cheese on top coupled with the meat sauce was quite tasty but very heavy.
The decor was definitely bizaarre as they had random things hanging from the ceiling. The bathroom was a little creepy with a recording of someone chanting random numbers.
One yelper stated that the servers randomly break out in song and dance but we didn't experience that.. bummer."
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,Katy H.,"The olive oil here was some of the best I've ever had. The focaccia was also tasty, and was mostly just helpful in getting more olive oil into my mouth. You should check this place out for that alone.
The pasta special was good, and even the cheese sprinkled on top was notable. Sadly, the steak was too tough and a bit overcooked with an overwhelming parsnip flavor.
When paired with the nice service, fun decor, and creamsicle pannacotta for dessert, this makes for a nice place to visit."
Bizzarro Italian Cafe,Jessica S.,"This is the kind of place that ""new Seattle"" needs more of - but not the kind of place you can build in a day. It's the opposite of generic and mod - it's utterly kitschy in the way that only a place that has been around for years can be: suspended from the ceiling are Christmas trees and bicycles for two, while under the glass table toppers are assorted antique photos, and so on. It's a visual treat.
Also a treat is the food. We started with Arancini balls, which were doused in a delicious fresh tomato sauce, but retained a crisp coating around the delicious, cheesy and gooey rice filling. From there, we had the soup of the day, a creamy garlic soup loaded with flavor, which is almost a meal in itself. For my main course, I had the spaghetti carbonara with pea shoots, which featured delightful, fresh pasta noodles, lightly sauced. Honestly, anything would be good with those noodles - they were perfection.
The waitress was friendly and very real, and service was prompt but well-paced. The placed was packed, and though we didn't have to wait for a table, there was a line out the door when we left.
So much old-school awesome! We'll be back."
Cortina,Hannah D.,"We had this on our list of places to go when we have a babysitter and finally got to go! We were pretty dressed up because it looked nice in photos. Most people there were very casual and had just got done shopping. Several families had little kids. I realize now that we could've just brought ours! Oh well!
I had the modern love cocktail to start. It had a super herby and interesting taste with an orchid on top. Very pretty for photos! But let's be honest, the whole restaurant is photo worthy and I'm a huge sucker for aesthetics. For dinner I had the rigatoni and it was a very generous portion. I could've probably saved half for a second dinner! It was amazing, like all Ethan Stowell food. My husband got the hanger steak and it was a VERY small portion, about 5 bites of steak with fries. He said it was very good, but not worth the $35 price tag. Can't wait to go back!"
Cortina,Allison T.,"Service: To start off, we made a reservation ahead of time through Yelp, but when we arrived ON TIME they said they had no record of our reservation. It wasn't a huge problem, though, because we were a party of two and they had plenty of seating open. We were seated at about 7:35pm and ordered at 7:45pm. We only ordered one appetizer and two entrees--the appetizer arrived about five minutes after ordering, but we did not receive the entrees for another 40 minutes. For a restaurant that was probably only about 40% occupied, it felt like an excessive wait. Also not sure if this was significant or not, but one thing we noticed is that each time someone came to take our order/check in on us, it was a different person each time.
Food: The food was actually pretty good. We got the focaccia for appetizer, and the gnocchi and the rigatoni.
Ambiance: Simple and elegant.
In fairness, I would give 3.5 stars, but the wait time for two pastas was actually pretty ridiculous. Even with the good food, I probably won't be back."
Cortina,Scott S.,"Cortina was a solid Italian establishment with a bit of an upscale vibe. It's in the ground floor of an office building, you can probably imagine exactly what it looks like.
We went as a group of 6 and shared a lot of appetizers such as squash and crostini. Then for dinner had a meat sauce pasta and a chicken dish. Both were pretty good.
Service was good as well. Solid restaurant if you're in the area, nothing I'd go too far out of my way for."
Cortina,Irene W.,"We came here for our friend's birthday and the experience here was amazing! We had a group of 10 and we made a reservation and were seated quickly! The ambience in here is very nice. It's dim but not too dark. The interior was simple with lots of tan wood. I had a lot of fun here, maybe it was the company, but the waiters/staff were super respectful and really just let us socialize while making sure our water cups were full.
The food here is really delicious. I'm really glad we went with a pasta/italian place. I ordered the linguini nero but EVERYTHING looks amazing. My second choice would have been the carbonara. It looked so delicious. The linguini was black noodles with lobster. It was slightly spicy but it complimented so well with the dish. I really enjoyed the pasta. I would absolutely recommend the linguini nero. Not only did it look really unique and cool, it tasted unique and yummy!
I'd recommend this place to everyone! I came with no expectations and left really happy."
Cortina,Frank D.,Excellent prices at happy hour from 4-6PM on a Sunday after the matinee at the 5th Ave Theater and they give a discount for season subscribers. 3 small plates and 2 pastas were more than enough. Beef tartare was excellent and the fish brushceta has a strong smokey delicious flavor. Fast responsive service. Clean modern decor. Very comfortable upscale atmosphere. Regular menu is more expensive but food is definitely worth it.
Cortina,Sophia K.,"I came here on my anniversary weekend with my boyfriend because I was craving pasta. The appetizers here looked sooooo good and the dining atmosphere looked very modern and simple -- both wins in my book.
Upon arriving, the reservation I made through yelp fell through but fortunately we were able to get seated right away. My bf and I ordered a TON of things, our server (who was super nice and friendly) even joked around thinking we couldn't finish. If I remember correctly, we ordered the bruschetta, beef tartare, fries, and two pastas and drinks. The wrong bruschetta came out so we actually had two at our table. While I can say the appetizers were absolutely amazing, the pasta as okay at best. At the time, I considered coming back just for the appetizers.
Now why do I give my experience three stars? I woke up at 5am the next morning with food poisoning and again 3 hours later throwing up everything I had in my stomach. I've never had food poisoning before so it was absolutely brutal. Suffice it to say, my boyfriend ate all the same things I did and he was totally fine. The only difference was that I ate the carbonara and he had the rigatoni.
Although having a shitty experience afterward (literally), I would recommend this restaurant to others but not entirely sure I would come back."
Cortina,Kate N.,"I always have crave for pasta and keep looking for new places to try . It's funny that @cortina was never in my list and I just tried it by coincidence. And I'm IN LOVE . Due' Cucina was used to be my top choice but now I must say that @cortina is the best!!!
.
I tried Bucatini (plenty of meatballs), Rigatoni ( my most favorite ), Linguine Nero (with Dungeness crab). All of them were super delicious! Perfectly cooked and seasoned, al dente pasta and good portion . I would loveee to come back again!
.
TIPS: the Linguine Nero is delicious but it tastes a little more sour compared to other pastas so you should try to eat this first before other dishes for the best taste!
.
P/s: their interior is beautiful and spacious as well!!! Everything is just perfect ."
Cortina,Dhanashree A.,"This place is one of the few which manages to have a slightly casual vibe inspite of such a classy decor. The place is really well lit and is ideal for groups.
Their menu is short which I really like. The food is really good as well. I went with a large group and was able to get reservations for Friday night easily. They don't have parking but you can always find street parking close by. I got to try their linguine Nero, gnocchi and my husband got their burger. For appetizers we got their focaccia, white bean bruschetta and their fries. The appetizers were decent. Fires were a little over seasoned and the focaccia would have been better if it was warm. Loved their bruschetta though, many textures and flavors. Their gnocchi was delicious, creamy, pillowy and cheesy. Most of our group got this and really liked it. I got their linguine Nero and really liked it. It's just a tad too sour. I think the peppers is what makes it so, if I knew I would have got mine without the peppers. The crab and the pasta itself is delicious though! My husband loved his burger. Perfect cook, perfect flavor.
The drinks are unique. They do serve usual versions of the drinks if you ask though. I tried their grapefruit mule. It's a little bitter, but if that's your thing you would love it. Service is on point! Our server was really helpful and patient. Would go back to try more!"
Cortina,Jen K.,"Party of three - my coworkers and I pop in for a midweek lunch at 11:10AM. We are greeted and asked if we have a reservation. There is a football fields length of empty tables in front of us. We say no. The gal steps away to confer with someone else. We are then escorted to the back of the restaurant and seated at a lounge table with slouchy chairs because ""this is what wE have available"". Really? There are at least 4 open booths and 20 + open tables around us. The tables gradually filled in but by the time we left there were still empty seats. So annoying and rude. Food was fine."
Cortina,Marissa E.,"Came here for restaurant week and it was so delicious! I need to come back and get the zeppoles again, they were dreamy. Would love to come back another time and try more dishes. Only thing is the service was super slow. Everyone was very kind and helpful but just had to wait a long time to order and between courses."
Cortina,Melody L.,"This is a nice Italian restaurant for a pre or post movie meal since it's near both Regal Meridian and AMC Pacific Place. I came here on a Friday night and did not need a reservation to sit at one of the tables near the bar. There weren't many people dining there, so the atmosphere was kind of quiet.
I had the bucatini and enjoyed it. It came with plenty of meatballs that I thought were just a tad dry, but the pasta was delightful. I was full by the end of the meal, so the portion size was acceptable by my standards. I paid around $30 including tax and tip, which is not too bad for a plate of fresh pasta."
Cortina,Jessica C.,"Happened upon here during restaurant week which means they limit their menu. However, their food is great. Partner got the bacon burger and loved it. He never accepts bacon in his burger but they did their so fantastically crispy, he let it slide. Also even though he ordered well done patty, it was still juicy. Less so from the meat and more so from the amazing flavors, like the special sauce and thinly sliced tomatoes.
I got the prosciutto as an appetizer with the carbonara pasta. The prosciutto was super soft with a cheese shaving on top. Would have liked a bit more cheese but it's OK. The pasta came with the yolk intact, allowing me to pierce it and spread across the fresh noodles."
Cortina,Jennifer M.,Elijah was a tremendous waiter! Very attentive and made our experience excellent! Top notch service! Will definitely be coming back!
Cortina,Emily J.,"I love noodles. This place had been on my bookmarks for a long time. I am not always in downtown Seattle where it would make visiting this place convenient but luckily this past week, I was. Plus my friend said it was one of the noodle places he really likes.
We walked in around 7pm on a Thursday night. Most tables were full, people before us had reservations, a few people in the waiting area, but lucky us, we got a table.
First things first, we ordered drinks. I ordered the Blackberry Margarita. It was refreshing and very appealing to the instagrammer eye. I wouldn't say you could easily tell there was alcohol in it but it was very tasty and easy to drink down quickly.
For food, I could not decide between the Uni Butter Spaghetti or the Carbonara. I asked the waiter for his recommendation and he said definitely the Carbonara with no hesitation. That made my indecisiveness go away and easily choose the Carbonara. My friend ordered the Uni Butter Spaghetti so I still ended up getting to try that as well. Both of those pastas were super good.
You may think it is crazy but we also ended up ordering an extra pasta dish to share. It was the Bucatini. Consider it normal since we did not get an appetizer. Normally I am a fan of anything Bucatini and the pasta was good but the sauce wasn't really anything special and the meatballs were try and kinda flavorless.
3/4 of the dishes being very good would still be considered a successful dinner in my opinion. I really wanted to try the Linguine Nero but the reviews made it sound like I would be disappointed so maybe another time.
If you are reading for the menu on their website, know it changes. Some of the pastas stay the same but they change some in and out. 10/10 would go here again."
Cortina,Edward S.,"Cortina is the latest restaurant from Ethan Stowell and I was glad to find it lived up to the standards of his other restaurants. It is a pretty large space and is nice and bright.
This is an Italian restaurant with a great menu. Service was superb--our server Elmelia was terrific. I started with the Buffalo mozzarella and the Brussels sprouts. The mozzarella dish was heavenly--the cheese tasted wonderful and was complemented beautifully with some sliced ham and pistachios (along with a few pieces of bread). The Brussels sprouts were cooked perfectly.
Next I had the parma pizza. The crust was a little soggy, but the toppings were excellent, particularly the prosciutto. It comes with a generous amount of arugula.
The last dish was my favorite--the fontina ravioli. The fresh pasta was great, but the cheese and truffle flavor was absolutely exquisite. This is a really good dish."
Cortina,Brittany I.,"Finally got to try this newer Ethan Stowell restaurant. It was fairly easy to make a reservation here for a large party during a week night, even the night before, which was great.
Overall, our dining experience, from service to food to ambiance, was very solid but nothing super stand out.
As for food, we tried a bunch of items but my favorites were the Prosciutto di Parma (SO smooth!) and Gnocchi al Telefonica (has a bit of a kick!). The Linguine Nero was a disappointment unfortunately. I was optimistic after reading reviews but after eating it, the flavor was really one-dimensional and lacking for me. There was also maybe only 2 small pieces of lobster. The breadcrumbs gave it a nice texture though.
My colleague had the Tonarelli Carbonara, which was good but not your traditional carbonara. This version is actually a bit lighter and less rich than most carbonaras I've eaten. Sometimes they are so rich you can't eat much. That isn't the case here. However, the pasta is thicker so that will fill you up quickly!"
Cortina,Meagan W.,"Honestly the food was really good, but due to the service I don't think I'd come again.
For a nice restaurant we were pretty disappointed with service. We made the mistake of saying ""no"" when asked if we had a show to get to- and proceeded to sit for 45 minutes waiting for our food while two other tables beside us sat down, and received two courses in the time we waited for one. We had a reservation and we weren't in a rush, but a 2 hour meal when everyone else was in and out in under an hour was disappointing. We are fairly certain our order got pushed behind EVERYONE going to a show- one or two in a rush wouldn't have been a big deal, but that was a really long time! Also, no one even noticed it had been that long- not even a ""sorry for the bit of a wait"".
But the food was good! We got the burratta, bruschetta, and ravioli and al were really tasty! I'd say average to smal portion size which is fine because they're all pretty rich food I'm not sure I could have eaten more of it (or I was full on water from my free time, you decide).
All in all, maybe it was our server, maybe it was an extra busy night? Not sure but I likely wouldn't be back or recommend to a friend based on our experience."
Cortina,Angelina T.,"We came here because this showed up on like every must go list. The interior is pleasant and spacious. Our server, Tom, went above and beyond; he was incredibly friendly and checked on us a few times. When I booked a reservation I notified Cortina that it was our anniversary and they gave us a surprise of two glasses of champagne at the end of our meal! We had three dishes: funghi pizza, potato gnocchi, and the special of the day which was king crab spaghetti.
Both the pizza and the gnocchi were great 4/5 stars. Everything was so filling my boyfriend and I felt like the both of us would've been full off of one of the three dishes if we shared it.
My only complaint is that the king crab pasta was super sour. It was unpleasant to eat and the white wine drowned out any potential flavour. It's a 1/5."
Cortina,Beth s.,"I am super stingy with my stars, but Cortina deserves this review. I'm in Seattle on Business, staying across the street at the Sheraton... The restaurant is across the street. Lucky me, showed up at 5:30 and it was happy hour. The HR menu is amazing with great full size options. Had the Burrata with olives for $8 and it was delicious and a large serving. Then had the pasta with pepper and parmesan $12. Super simple, clean and flavorful. Generous portion, I could only eat about half of it. Also, the service was perfect. Super attentive, without being overbearing. Highly recommend you check this place out.. Final thought, love the atmosphere. Modern and comfortable with a huge bar which is key when your traveling on your own!"
Cortina,Katie S.,"I love the appetizers and drinks! Especially the torta and prosciutto. Pizza is great too. The service was really disappointing, including from the manager. My friend asked for her bill three times and was snapped at (everyone around her got their bill without asking for it so not sure why she had to repeat herself after waiting at least 10 minutes). Hoping my next experience will have better service because I really enjoy the happy hour and the atmosphere."
Il Terrazzo Carmine,Nick P.,"What can I say?
My beautiful wife took me here for my birthday this past Monday Dec 30th.
They gave us the very best table in the house for two in the corner.
Waiter and everyone else beyond our highest expectations.
Food from appetizer to desserts was spot on.
I had Osso Buco and she ordered the Veal Scallopini.
Waiter picked us a beautiful Pinot Noir as well.
I cannot say enough about the special find.
We will be back every time we visit Seattle!
Thanks to everyone for a great night we will always remember!"
Il Terrazzo Carmine,Isaac H.,"It was a stormy night and we were less than prepared. We skipped the Lyft to save money and arrived wet. We shed our jackets, prayed for warmth, and were soon placed at the only table by the back door. Customers entered every five minutes and blasted our damp clothes with cold air all night! We never warmed up.
That aside, the food was high-caliber, with fine appetizers and stellar entrees:
- Appetizer taster: 4 stars
- Crab bruschetta: 4 stars
- Mushroom polenta: 4 stars
- Seafood ravioli: 5 stars
- Duck w/cherry: 5 stars
We left our table for a while to avoid the cold and watch the chefs do their work over the counter of the open kitchen. Their hands dashed between dozens of pans on dramatic open flames. With dishes like these, I'll always accept complimentary food to return and consider a higher rating!"
Il Terrazzo Carmine,Alyssa R.,"The pasta was pretty basic to me. What really got me was the I've had the best duck dish I've ever had, would come back here all the time for that!
And the service was great, always checked up on us, never had my water hit the bottom."
Il Terrazzo Carmine,Saumya A.,"Have been there 2 times on different occasions and both times it's been awesome upscale experience. Pastas are delicious. We ordered vegetarian pesto pasta with request to chef to add some house veggies and he made it lovely. It had the right amount of pesto sauce and pine nuts. House breads are also nice.
Daily soup was lentil soup and Zuppa di cuvolo and they were good as well."
Il Terrazzo Carmine,Dave K.,"Great Italian Restaurant in Downtown Seattle.
This is not a family style super loud old school Italian restaurant. But if you are looking for a great spot for a work dinner / lunch or maybe a quiet spot for dinner with the wife - the food here is GREAT. Great wine selection as well.
Fried calamari - 5 star delicious. Super tender. Super flavorful. Perfect.
Caesar - 4.5 very good. The romaine is a little too green for me but they give you anchovies which I love.
Veal Scaloppini - 4.5 star very good. A great serving and the sauce was perfect.
Pasta's - 4 star. I've had a few and they are good but not blow your socks off good.
Service and bar are top notch.
I will definitely be back. I wouldn't bring the kids or a big family but if you are looking for a quiet Italian dinner with a great bottle of wine - this is it."
Il Terrazzo Carmine,Wendy K.,"The company I work for our Admin Day lunch here on April 24th this year. I already love this place but was even more impressed by how they handled a large party. We were originally going to have about 20 and were going to have a private space, but stuff happens and the number went down to about 12-15 they adjusted things quickly we were no longer in the private area but everything went smoothly. One of the things they do well here has always been the service. Friendly and very accommodating. My go to is always the Spaghettini Ortolano
with arugula, goat cheese, tomatoes and pine nuts. It's a nice light pasta dish perfect for spring and summer. Even if it was winter I would order it! The combination of all the ingredients just works perfectly.
Our entire table had a varied ends of orders from just soup and salad to salads with pasta entrees. Almost all of us got dessert after being presented with the beautiful dessert display. I went with the canolli which is not something I usually order but I enjoyed theirs immensely. Nice and crisp and just the right balance of everything else. Our waiter was so entertaining. We all had a wonderful time."
Il Terrazzo Carmine,Jessica N.,"This place has been around since the 80s and I'm just now discovering it! Hidden gem in Seattle. Traditional Italian food and all the dishes were great! Service was good and ambiance is so cute! I especially love the outside, nice place to sit on a warmer Seattle evening.
If I had to recommend one dish i guess it'd be the cioppino - broth was so flavorful and packed with fresh seafood. Very good! Also really liked the shrimp pasta with pesto.
So glad I found it! Can't wait to return."
Il Terrazzo Carmine,Naveed N.,"Il Terrazzo Carmine has been a long time favorite of mine in Seattle. You don't come here looking for the hip or swanky hipster foodie restaurant scene. Those culinary fads have a place of their own, but Seattle is also home to some great classic and traditional fine dining experiences. Being in the northwest, this isn't a stuffy upscale experience but holds its own to great restaurants while still maintaining a sense of comfort and familiarity.
Having introduced a friend to this place a few months prior, we tentatively planned to come in for dinner sometime early in the new year and that time finally came around.
We ordered the baked eggplant, and the Caeser salad to start while deciding on a bottle of wine. Both were great choices, and while I'm not going to deduct points here- I would like to point out to management that the eggplant dish could have come out more warm. If you're one to enjoy the creaminess of eggplant while it is still hot with a well-melted cheese, perhaps you can make that request.
For dinner, we shared the gnocchi Sorrentina, the pesto prawn fettuccine, and the roasted free-range duck. The pesto was fresh and vibrant, with prawns cooked to perfection. The Gnocchi light and flavorful, and the duck was a great choice as well, despite being torn between that and the bone-in pork chop (next time..)
Overall a fantastic experience brought to a perfect close with a couple of espressos and a creme brulee to share. Whether it is a special occasion, celebration, date night, or just another excuse for a nice dinner out- don't miss out on Il Terrazzo Carmine. Cheers!"
Il Terrazzo Carmine,Alecia P.,"I could be bias because my boyfriend and I were celebrating our 4 year anniversary. But so far, one of my top pasta places in Seattle. From an amazing dinner to the incredible service, our evening was well spent! We both agreed that this was one of our best dining experiences we've ever had. It was definitely very memorable. We were very lucky to have a table since we reserved last minute for anniversary!
Our hostess and server were incredible. You know it's legit, when your hostess offers to take your jackets. At the end of night, she noticed taking our selfies outside and offered to take our photos. How sweet was she! Low key, she probably saw us struggling. And man, our server was so so kind and very attentive! He knew the menu from the heart.
It was a seafood night for us. For our antipasti, we started out with the Bruschetta con Granchio (dungeness crab w/ vine marinated tomatoes w/ basil oil). It was something we normally don't order, but it was very refreshing starter! I think we should've ordered something else to start since we ended up order more seafood.
- For his dish, he requested for the Linguine Alle Vongole (fresh Manila calms, chilies, garlic, parsley, & olive oil). He probably won't order this dish again because he's not a huge fan on Linguine, but he really wanted clams & he got a bunch of them!
- Me on the other hand ordered the Ravioli Pesce (large ravioli filled w/ crab, shrimp and spinach, with lobster sauce). Rich was so rich and buttery. It served well with the crab. I'm a very saucy girl, so I do wish there was more sauce since the crab didn't have too much seasoning.
At the end of the night, we were full on the amazing bread with this sweet balsamic vinegar and oil olive, topped with this creme brûlée we choose from their dessert tray! Definitely keep this restaurant on our books and coming back. Cute date spot and to dress up for!"
Il Terrazzo Carmine,Reilly M.,"My favorite Italian in Seattle! Always get the best service, & great wine recs. Great for any special occasion! Sit in the bar if you want it to be more casual"
Il Terrazzo Carmine,Susan C.,"Extraordinary service and food. They were prompt if not too print to serve us and get our food out as a concert awaited at Century Link.
Outstanding appetizers of calamari, prosciutto with melon. I ordered to Dungeiness crab risotto which was a large portion and really savory. Just melted in my mouth. High quality ingredients and prompt table service made this my best meal of the month!
My friend ordered osso Bucci and was very pleased.
You MUST have reservation here. Very popular especially before an event at the Link."
Il Terrazzo Carmine,Karen Z.,"My friend and I had a very memorable dinner here earlier this week -- hands down one of the best dining experiences I've had in Seattle. We were so impressed with the food and the service was perfect, down to the last detail.
We ordered:
- Half a dozen oysters (5/5): So good and very fresh.
- Fricasse Di Funghi Selvaggi (5/5): This absolutely blew us away. The wild mushrooms were perfectly sauteed and seasoned, and the polenta was amazing - very flavorful without being overly salty.
- Scaloppine Di Vitello Al Limone & Capperi (5/5): The waiter, seeing how indecisive I was between ordering a pasta or this entree, kindly told me they could replace the red potatoes in this dish with whichever type of pasta I liked, so I decided on a side of linguini with pesto -- which was so simple but delicious. The veal itself was nicely done (it's more like a cutlet). All the entrees were served with a side of white broccolini, which I'd never had before but looked beautiful and tasted fresh! Was truly impressed with the attentiveness to detail at Il Terrazzo Carmine.
- I can't quite remember the name of the dessert -- the ""menu"" was actually a platter of 6 options they had that night, so we choose a 3-layered cake with a side of vanilla ice cream. It was amazing! They also had creme brulee, tiramisu, cheesecake, red velvet cake, etc.
Definitely want to come back here! Beautiful ambiance, delicious food, delightful service :-)"
Il Terrazzo Carmine,Vaishali K.,"The patio seating is superb. Cozy and beautiful. The salads were both delicious. A definite must try! However, the veg pastas did disappoint us. Both of them tasted pretty bland and the arabiatta was just spicy, no other flavor. BUT THE DESSERT TRAY WAS SUPERB! the red velvet was delicious. I would go back for the dessert tray and the salads at their patio!"
Il Terrazzo Carmine,Marvin G.,"A good restaurant with good and pleasant service. I had hoped it would be outstanding as some of their reviews and certainly the prices suggest. The pasta dishes were fairly robust, though not super flavorful. Soups were pleasant if a little scant on ingredients. Bread was very good, though served with butter rather than olive oil and vinegar. Our server did the thing listing the dinner specials without mentioning prices, which always bugs me (it seems manipulative; you have to ask the price and feel like a cheapskate, or order and hope for the best while feigning wealthy nonchalance, or just avoid the specials altogether).
Tends more toward art food than a solid meal, not quite in the ""eat before you go"" category but leaning that way. Noise level was quite tolerable. A little too much reliance on salt in the dishes, though not terrible.
I'd go back but would not go out of my way to."
Il Terrazzo Carmine,Aaron P.,Seattle is now known for its Italian! Thank you for the perfect birthday! From the wine list to the sweets! Bravo.
Il Terrazzo Carmine,Steve L.,"So very good!
We stopped in Friday evening before a show for dinner. I started at the bar and had a drink while awaiting the arrival of my better half. I talked to the bartender and he offered to go back to the restaurant and see if he might get us a table. As luck would have it they had one table left and we got it.
From start to finish everything was first rate and amazingly tasty. Our server was attentive and skilled - exactly what I look for to help guide us in a new place.
Prices were appropriate for such an extremely high caliber restaurant. We both agreed that this was one of the very best dining experiences we've ever had.
I'd recommend this place for your next special occasion.
Reservations are advised - you may not be as lucky as we were."
Il Terrazzo Carmine,Melissa L.,"Made reservations for an Italian dinner on a Saturday night and it exceeded my expectations.
Its located in the back of the lobby of Merrill Place. We arrived on time and stepped inside to the Host stand. They gave us the option of inside or outside and we opted to be seated outside since it was a beautiful, warm, summer evening.
The patio has chandeliers, fire pit, white linens, candlelights and fresh flowers on the tables and pillows at my seat. It was beautiful.
Service was very good and attentive. Water and bread was brought out quickly to the table.
We started with Prosciutto con Melone. Cantaloup is in season and it was delivered ripe with imported parma prosciutto. Very Good.
Ordered a 1/2 dozen of the oysters of the day. These were fresh and served at the perfect temperature and with a mignonette. The mignonette was all that was needed to balance the saltiness.
For my entree, I ordered the Risotto of the Day. Served w/Wagyu and Gorgonzola. The wagyu was not as tender/buttery as I expected and the gorgonzola was mild. I had hoped for stronger flavors. However, the risotto was prepared well.
We were too full to consider dessert.
Good cocktail & wine selection; started with a cocktail and ended with a chianti.
Service was attentive and spot on.
Borderline 5 star experience; a repeat visit may bring it up to 5 stars."
Il Terrazzo Carmine,Luis G.,"We really enjoyed our dishes and are definitely coming back. I ordered Bistecca, my wife Cioppino Nostrano.
The steak was tender and cooked to perfection, delicious."
Il Terrazzo Carmine,Tanya D.,"Beautiful atmosphere. Amazing selection of food and wine. Service was beyond excellent! Eric was our waiter. He was pleasant, knowledgeable & went out of his way to make everything perfect for us."
Il Terrazzo Carmine,Katie Y.,"Yummm, I love Il Terrazzo Carmine. We came here on a weekday around dinnertime and had failed to make a reservation in advance. Luckily, they said they could seat us if we were out within an hour and a half - of course, we agreed.
We started with the caprese and the burrata, and although the portions were a bit small to split between 4 people, the dishes were spectacular. Service was a little bit slow, as was the food - we had kept up our end of the bargain by being ready to order almost as soon as we sat down and went over the 90m mark. Luckily, the host came over and told us that he had sorted out things on his end and we were free to stay as long as we liked.
I highly, highly recommend the fettuccine al pesto. The prawns it come with are a healthy portion, and the noodles are clearly homemade as they almost melt in your mouth. It's flavorful and a decent sized portion. This place does feel a bit stuffy, but I think that's the vibe they're going for. We had just came from work so we all had our work backpacks/bags with us and felt a little out of place having to find somewhere to place them, as the restaurant is a little crowded with tables. Still, if you're a pasta lover then this place is one I'd highly recommend for you."
Il Nido,Dave C.,"So very glad this outstanding restaurant has settled into the historic Homestead Cabin just off Alki Beach.
We've had three meals now, no easy feat given the intense demand for reservations since they opened last summer. They all were among the very best we've had in Seattle. The pasta dishes change frequently and are all beautifully textured and popping with fresh fresh flavors, perfectly sauced. The antipasto are mostly light and bright; I have no idea how they source such extraordinary ingredients in the dead of winter. And the primi & secondi are all prepared so perfectly (so far) - the ribeye with a light, crispy crust containing stunning fatty bursts with each bite - the lamb beautifully prepared with the most delicately fruity/minty sauce - the black cod or salmon also beautifully sauced.
Service is elegantly casual, and the selection of wine is wonderful. Cocktails are also so well prepared.
I have no idea how this place is rated only 4 stars - this place is of the caliber of Salare, Cafe Juanita, and Canlis."
Il Nido,Joline T.,"TL;DR Chef makes the simple things shine
Reservations: Seriously prohibitive and a pain. Reservations are open 30 days at a time. Reservations open at midnight. Had to book a month out at 12:01 am.
Parking: There's a lot right next door to the building. Signs will say parking for Homestead only; that's for Il Nido at the Homestead.
Burrata and prosciutto: Burrata was incredibly fresh and light, prosciutto was beautifully delicate and perfectly salty paired with the fresh burrata. Hands down the best prosciutto I've ever had.
Tagliatelle with bolognese: Tagliatelle was a little more al dente than I've had at other places; I loved the chew. I hate to compare it to Il Corvo, but how do you not? I also haven't been to Il Corvo for a couple years now because the line is impossible now. Based on my v distant memory, Il Corvo was just as good for half the price. But since I can't get Il Corvo anymore, then I'll pay for chef's pasta at Il Nido.
Cauliflower steak: it was fine. Gorgonzola was an interesting pairing that I've never had before. Gorgonzola wasn't overwhelming, but it was too much for me. That's a very personal taste thing though.
Pork cheeks with dried pear slices and polenta: Pork cheeks were didnt-need-a-fork tender. The sweetness of the pear complemented the earthiness of the pork cheeks. The polenta was the best I ever had. Crispy on the outside, fluffy soft the inside. Nice cheese flavor without being cheesy.
Would def come back!"
Il Nido,Parisa E.,"Il Nido is truly what an Italian experience should be! Cozy, fresh, and wanting more!
Getting reservations are tough (1 month in advance and opens at midnight). Once you dine there the hostess will ask if you want to make more reservations so we made 2 more 3-4 months in advance. I thought this was a really nice touch making them value their customers!
Food was amazing and pasta was cooked perfectly! I was really surprised and amazed by the desert both the taste and presentation! The log cabin is so cozy and perfect for a night out!"
Il Nido,Sylvia K.,"We were able to snag last minutes reservations for two on the Resy site on the day of (there was a cancellation!) at 8pm. We've been wanting to eat at Il Nido for months since it opened. The Resy site was easy to use and we got an email confirmation plus a text reminder an hour before our reservation.
We arrived a few minutes early (there's a small parking lot but we easily found street parking - Alki in winter is a lot less busy) and the host seated us right away. The historic Alki Homestead building has been beautifully restored. The interior is gorgeous and because it's December there were Christmas decorations which was lovely.
Our server Chad came over and told us the special (which was a cheese plate) and gave us some time to look over the menu. Everything on the menu sounded good. We decided on the special cheese plate (which came with a soft cheese from Cowgirl Creamery), the sage pappardelle in rabbit sugo, and the cider braised pork cheek. We asked the server to recommend a wine to go with our dinner and he suggested the arneis.
The arneis wine was lovely and paired well with our food. The cheese plate was yummy - the cheese was good and the housemade quince paste was delicious. Our pasta dish was my favorite part of the meal. The sage pappardelle was amazing and cooked perfectly. The rabbit meat was tender (and plentiful) and the sauce was light tasty. The pork cheek was also delicious and the flavor was great and the meat was also really tender (didn't even need a knife!). This polenta cake came with the pork cheek and that was super salty. Not sure if they just added too much salt or they added enough salt but didn't account for the polenta soaking up additional sauce, but it was way too salty.
Overall, the meal was delicious - the pasta and the proteins were good and the service was excellent, and the ambiance was perfect. I loved the log cabin interior and the christmas decorations. The only reason I couldn't give a full five stars was because of the overly salty polenta cake. For the prices and for the difficulty of getting reservations, I would expect all the food to be perfect. I'll definitely come back for the pasta (if we can somehow get reservations again)!"
Il Nido,Jacqueline H.,"I was so excited to go to Il Nido because I am a huge Il Corvo fan. It's a bit difficult to make reservations, but was able to get a table for a Thursday night. The restaurant is in a very cute log cabin-esque venue and is super cozy when you go inside. Service was amazing the whole night and they even took our coats and bags when we sat. They have different specials each night, which is introduced by the server who was very helpful and checked in multiple times throughout our meal. We tried the bruschetta, which is delicious and fatty - I would recommend getting a salad as an appetizer though because it'll help balance out the carbs later. We also ordered the ragu pasta and pesto pasta. I think these are always on the menu, but they were both delicious and perfectly cooked, much like at Il Corvo. Lastly, we ordered the tiramisu, which honestly was not that good. I wouldn't order it again. Despite that, the rest of the food was incredible and service was top notch. Would highly recommend coming in, especially if you want a high quality dining experience!"
Il Nido,Marie B.,"I am behind in my Yelp reviews coming up on one year, however, despite that sleep eludes me, I am compelled to post a Yelp review for Il Nido (10/9/19).
Big fan of pretty much whatever project Chef Mike Easton, his wife Victoria, and their team are involved in....from the early days of Bizarro, Lecosho, and when Il Corvo was sharing space with a gelato shop at the Pike Place Market Hillclimb. Well before those infamous weekday lines on James between 2nd and 3rd Avenues.
Since I'm a northender and work way up in North Lynnwood for 4.5 years, it is rare to have that amazing bowl of pasta, that kale salad, the proscuitto/pickled celery plate, selection of olives, and/or the delicious shortbread cookies from Il Corvo.
There are plenty of other worthy sites all over the city, but with traffic, parking, budget, and other logistics, sometimes having amazing hand crafted pasta takes major strategic planning.
I was among the masses awaiting the restoration of the Alki Homestead and the opening of Il Nido. Wasn't among the first to dine in mid May though and regretfully had to cancel a reservation in June. Then to learn it's booked a month or so out, are you f-ing kidding me?
Spring and summer flies by. Autumn is well underway with the colorful foliage and brisk breeze.
On a whim, turned my attention to the Resy site yesterday to see if I can nail a unicorn reservation to Il Nido. I literally had to blink in disbelief at six available slots for today. Time to check it out, and see why Yelp reviews run the entire spectrum, and why the wide disparity?
I left my home with a two hour cushion to make that trek to West Seattle. Not bad, in 30 minutes I was exiting off the bridge onto Harbor Avenue. Beautiful views of the water and the downtown Seattle skyline, I periodically stopped to admire and photograph. Located Il Nido (see posted tip) and a parking space right out front, then basked in the sun.
They don't unlock the main entrance until 5pm sharp. So I had an opportunity to admire the building exterior and well kept garden beds, plus chat with a trio of other women seated at the front bench. More folks also started appearing on the porch. Nice and orderly we all entered, thankfully no Black Friday-like pushing and shoving.
Once inside taking it all in, very aesthetically pleasing, and an amazing interior restoration. I had a brief flashback to two Willows Inn visits with the similarities of welcoming warmth, natural light, and lots of focal points.
Checked in at the host stand and was promptly brought to a two top, where I was taken care of by Chad and his other Il Nido colleagues. I was pleased to learn that the seasonal menu recently had changed, but passed on this evening's special of rabbit. ""Thumper"" at Cafe Juanita nearly two decades ago still gives me PTSD.
So here's the run down of what I indulged in:
*Rubicon ($14) Bourbon, black walnut bitters, fig sugar, on the rocks. Nice strong and smooth cocktail.
*Contorni ($11) Mixed chicories salad with anchovy dressing, perfectly soft boiled egg, and copious parmigiano atop. Wish the greens weren't quite so cold temperature wise, but ate about a third with the egg. Kindly the rest was boxed up.
*Primi Pasta ($24) Lumache, winter squash cream, crisp fried sage, and cookie dust. Delicious seasonal pasta. This is where others balk at either the pasta prices, quantity, or both. I ate half with all the sage leaves. Again, kindly the rest was boxed up.
*Secondi Bistecca Ribeye ($49) requested medium rare and served atop tender salad greens. The juices on the greens were spot on tasty. I was blown away by the quality, preparation, and presentation of the ribeye steak. Perfectly seasoned, juicy, tender...barely didn't need the steak knife provided. Again, ate half with all the salad greens. Yes, another box filled.
*Savored the ribeye with a glass of 2016 Avennia Gravura ($16/glass) a full bodied Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Cabernet Franc from Columbia Valley. The pour definitely complemented the steak.
*For dessert, Espresso with biscotti ($3) and the Chocolate Salami dessert special ($10) added the exclamation point to my dinner. Slices of chocolate speckled with ladyfingers to mimic the salami, served in addition with hazelnut brittle, plum and apple slices, and a berry compote. Nicely composed, not cloying, and terrific flavors and textures.
I enjoyed my brief exchanges with the wait staff throughout my meal and the host staff upon departing. I dined alone, but was well attended to and the entire meal was well paced.
Il Nido is an impressive neighborhood gem, fresh seasonal items showcased from local purveyors, spot on professional service, contributing to an overall, thoroughly enjoyable dining experience."
Il Nido,Huong L.,"I was super excited about this place when i first heard about it. I even woke up at like 3am to try to get reservations... I guess my expectation was too high that it was kind of a let down...
The place itself is very rustic and homey so it was a mix between being casual and fancy.
As you get seated, your server comes over to explain the menu as it change frequently, which is nice. We ended up getting following:
the special of the day which is a papadel noodle with a rabbit ragu - the pasta here is the same as il corvo - perfectly cooked, great flavors, but 2-3x more expensive than il corvo...
the quail wrapped with bacon - this was a very well balanced dish, the quail wrapped in bacon was cooked perfectly, and it was savory and rich, which was balanced out by some vibrant greens and plums.
braised green dish - did not expect this dish to be so southern style. It was kinda heavy and more beans than braised green, also kinda bland.
Poached pear in red wine with crumble - pretty good. You get a nice surprise when you cut the pear open as it is filled with cream. Also very light and not super sweet.
In summary, the food was ok, some good, some ok, but nothing extraordinary. The pasta was perfect but I rather wait at il corvo as it is cheaper and you can get more options. The wait for food here was almost as long which confuse me because they have an idea of how many people will be here through reservation so I don't know why it took so long for food to come out (it took almost 30 minutes for our dessert!)
The highlight of my meal??? The little biscotti sample they gave at the very end. It was probably the best biscotti I ever eaten. But they gave us 1.5 bitr pieces for 2 people...not sure what that is about either .."
Il Nido,Julia C.,"We were so excited to get a reservation here because of all the hype.
A little underwhelmed, nothing was bad but wouldn't say anything was amazing either. Pastas were all cooked perfectly, the bucatini was definitely our favorite dish. I would say it is worth checking out as I believe their dishes change continuously based on the seasons. Glad we came and tried Il Nido, it was worth the trek to West Seattle ;)"
Il Nido,Julie P.,"Great atmosphere, good service & delicious food! I'm a fan!
Everything we tried here was very good but the only thing that was a little disappointing was the portion was a bit lacking compared to other Italian restaurants, especially because it is on the pricier side.
We got the Castelvetrano Foccacia Bread to start off (unfortunately, bread does not come with the meal hahah) but man, it was worth paying for it because it was delicious.
We also tried the Rigatoni Nero & the Wild Boar Tagliatelle. The tagliatelle was cooked to perfection! It was so good - I think this was my favorite dish! The Rigatoni Nero lacked sauce - the pasta was a bit dry, but I did like that there was a lot of octopus in the dish. The Wood-grilled Saddle of Lamb was really yummy but it was pretty small! Haha I must have been super hungry. We finished our meal with Tiramisu dessert! My all time favorite and it did not disappoint!
Overall, I would definitely recommend everyone to try this place at least once! I will definitely come back for special occasions - IF we can get a reservation! They book out months in advance... We got super lucky and came here on the week of their opening because my friend ending up giving me her reservation! :) Thanks Il Nido - we had a great experience here."
Il Nido,Rebecca T.,"My boyfriend was able to snag us a table at il Nido the day of after waiting on the waitlist for a while- so don't give up!!
I am a huge fan of il corvo so of course when I heard about il nido opening up, I desperately needed to try it! The menu seemed to have rotated recently so I have the updated menu below!
For starters we ordered the chicories salad and bruschetta al lardo. Both were absolutely delicious! Fair warning, the chicories salad was pretty bitter so if you don't like bitter tastes don't get it! The bruschetta was sooo good. The bread was very fresh & the butter was so creamy!
For pastas, we ordered the rigatoni with braiseed beef & the bucatini with pork. The pasta was cooked very al dente just like how they do it over at il corvo. The beef sauce was pretty heavy and packed full of flavors. There were big beef chunks in it too! The bucatini had little pork pieces and was definitely a lot less strong but still very flavorful as well. I'm glad I was able to have a little of both for some balance. The pasta portions were the same as il corvo's!
For dessert we had the tiramisu which was pretty good (nothing special though!)"
Il Nido,Silvia V.,"Amazing place!!
Reservation recommended if you want to sit in the restaurant or there is a small bar for 2-people party. Without reservation you may have to wait for a while.
The food: delicate, flavorful, and beautiful! We had wine and a full menu with appetizers, entrees (lamb and pasta), dessert and coffee. Really great!
Service: impeccable! Friendly host and nice waiter.
Price: totally appropriate for the quality you get. It is on the fancy date side but definitely worth every penny!
Atmosphere: calm and perfect for conversations!
Just an outstanding place and a gem in the area!!
Thanks for the beautiful experience!
Silvia & Joel"
Il Nido,Laura C.,"A bit of a let down compared to Il Corvo. In general, expectations were very high coming to this restaurant hoping the pasta would be the same as their lunch spot.
The meal was quite unmemorable, but I remember the dishes being very small and the pastas not living up to what they serve at Il Corvo. For what you pay in price, I would expect a bit more from Il Nido."
Il Nido,Robyn C.,"Went here for opening night with high expectations. I knew the pasta was going to be great, but I had one question... is it worth it? Yes. The service was great. Our server actually engaged with us about the menu rather than just telling us ""the special"" and the usual ""thanks for joining us"".
Small menu but, the dishes were well executed.
The octopus rigatoni was 5/5!! A heaping portion of baby octopus, pasta and oh man- the spices. I try not order squid, octopus or even scallops at restaurants because it tends to be over cooked, but I'm really glad I gave it a go! Also tried the trout. The olives and the fennel really enhanced the flavor of the fish.
Then came the tiramisu. It wasn't as ""soaked"" as I would've liked, which made the flavor more like just any other ""coffee cake"". I wasn't so sure about the chocolate garnish because it just ended up bigger than the actual tiramisu... was it supposed to be a shell? I'm not sure.
All in all, it was good food. The ocean view near by isn't so bad either."
Il Nido,Emily J.,"When the reservations opened for Il Nido, I immediately jumped on resy to book for a weekend night. Looking back on it, I am glad I did because when I was debating moving it, all the reservations for June were taken.
Having been to Il Corvo one time before, I kinda knew what I was getting myself into by going here. If you are unfamiliar with their style, which I assume you aren't since you are on their yelp page, you now know what type of menu they have and what their dishes look like.
The prices are not low. I would not come here on a budget or thinking you are going to get quantity or quality. You are going here for the quality.
Reviewing the menu, each dish seems thoughtfully put together and you can see that in the presentation as each of your items gets placed onto your table.
For my date night, we started off with a drink. I asked for a fruity suggestion and ended up ordering the Cool Waves. It was definitely fruity, somewhat strong, and very tasty.
For the appetizer, we ordered the burrata and the 24 month prosciutto. If you have never had a burrata before, it is a fresh Italian milk cheese. When you see it, you probably are thinking rich and dense but it is actually what I would consider light, clean, and subtle. A very delicate flavor in my opinion. If you cannot handle dairy or are not a fan of milk, maybe skip it, otherwise I would recommend. The prosciutto was kinda gamey? A unique taste and little on the salty side.
The main course items we chose were the ricotta cavatieddi, roman style pomodoro and the wood grilled saddle lamb, corona beans, charred spring onions, peas. I, obviously, chose the pasta. It was exactly what I was expecting. Really good and I could of ate a huge portion of it. It was the perfect size if you had an appetizer before. If you did not, you would probably consider it small. The wood grilled saddle lamb was delicious. It melt in your mouth and had great flavor. The beans on the other hand, were just okay.
Overall, the meal was good but pricey. If you need to eat a ton, be ready to open up your wallet. Would I go back? Definitely! But only if other people wanted to go.
Parking - They do have a few spaces on the left, if you are driving by and facing the restaurant. They seem like they are normally open if you have either the 5pm or 5:30 pm reservation. If you have a later reservation, fingers crossed that you get a spot or else you get the joy of driving around alkai looking for street parking."
Il Nido,Kirstie C.,"I basically love everything about this place from the location, the architecture, mood/ambiance, decor, and especially the food.
Love that they tie in seasonal items to their menu along with specials that change so you get a good variety to choose from. I definitely recommend this spot and will be going back for sure."
Il Nido,Ben C.,"I haven't look forward to a restaurant opening since I lived in Washington DC about two years ago. Il Nido is the sit-down restaurant cousin of the famed Il Corvo walk-up Italian lunch spot in Pioneer Square.
I've followed the restaurant's development on Instagram and I have to say that it's one of the most beautifully designed and spacious restaurants that I've been to. Maybe it's just because they're getting a feel for running operations and don't want to overwhelm themselves but I appreciate not having to trip over chairs walking around the main dining area.
The menu consists of a handful of appetizers, four pasta dishes, a selection of salads, and three 'secondi' main dishes. The chef handmakes each pasta that goes on the night's menu-- the wheat berries used to make the cornetti were even toasted prior to grinding.
The focaccia was quite possibly even better than the one at Il Corvo-- for the first time in my life I actually ate an olive and enjoyed it. The staff encourage you to share dishes family-style so as to get enough of a taste of everything. All pasta was amazing, but I found a couple of the dishes to be served a bit colder than I would have hoped for. The dessert was out of this world good-- the tiramisu was utterly delicate and the panna cotta made me roll the eyes into the back of my head.
I'm really excited for this restaurant and am super interested to see how it develops over the coming years!"
Il Nido,Maddie E.,"Is this place all it's cracked up to be? Yes, and then some. I've been lucky enough to come here twice in the past three months. Getting a reservation is tough and you have to be flexible with your dates/times, even if that means eating dinner at 9pm. The service is absolutely five stars and the ever-changing menu brings new surprises each visit. Can't wait for my next trip in February!"
Il Nido,Audrey C.,"I cannot believe how difficult it was to get reservations here... I literally had to check back almost every day to see if anyone had cancelled and it still took a couple weeks. In the end we had a great experience and the food was delicious, but definitely on the pricier side for West Seattle. That said, given how busy this place is, I think there is plenty of demand for a littler pricier dining in West Seattle. I mean, how many more pizza places do we need?
We ordered a bottle of wine, two drinks, two pastas, burrata & 24 month prosciutto, focaccia, lamb, and tiramisu, and that was plenty and bit overkill for the two of us. But if you wait for that long to try a place, you might as well try as much as you can. I think our bill ended up being $260 including tip, so I would put it on the special occasion list or a couple times a year list. There are some lower priced Italian options in West Seattle that offer some pretty decent handmade pasta as well, but this place seemed like a level above and the service was really good.
Overall, will definitely be back to try it out again once things have died down a bit and reservations are easier.
Note- there is a bar which I assume is walk-up and you can order off their main menu, but can't confirm. There were a limited number of seats at the bar, maybe 8-10"
Il Nido,Tuan N.,"I'll preface this by saying it's more like 3.5*
We've been waiting for this place to open up seeing how much we loved Il Corvo, but tough to make it there only during lunches.
With Il Nido open for dinner, we can have more of a chance to have delicious pasta.
First off the building, decor was welcoming like a home and service was on point from the greet to sit down. Our server was honest about the food and gave suggestions about what he thought were the stars and which dishes might needs to be tweaked.
We had the bruschetta, king oyster mushroom, and two different pasta and a couple of drinks.
The bruschetta came with a lard spread that was delicious but the bread was so burnt, they actually took it off our bill and gave us focaccia bread.
The mushroom dish was a great appetizer with right amount of saltiness and earthiness. This restored my thought that it's going to be a great meal.
However, when the two pasta dish came out it was a tale of two pasta. The gemelli sauce was great but the pasta itself a bit overcooked and fell apart. The cavadetti texture was perfect but sauce could have used a bit more salt. Some small changes would have made them perfect like I'm used at at Il Corvo. Also, the portions were on a smaller side even for fine dining.
Overall, they just opened not so long ago so hopefully they work out the small missteps by the time we dine there again."
Il Nido,Alexis M.,"Set my alarm for midnight exactly 30 days before the night I wanted to eat here to get the reservation on open table. Getting a reservation is a hassle, but it's definitely worth the wait. The service was amazing... one of the best I've experienced at any other restaurant in Seattle. The tables were all spaced out far apart, so each party had plenty of privacy. I saw people were raving about the focaccia, and it was good, but many other dishes were much more impressive. The ciccioli pork rillette antipasti dish was amazing!!! Our waiter described it to us as like an Italian Pâté. It was so tasty!!! The pasta dishes were all amazing as well. I had the sage pappardelle rabbit sugo. The pasta was cooked perfectly and you could really taste the sage!! My dad got the pasta special-- the scallops ravioli-- and he thought it was delicious, but I think he was even more impressed by the pork cheeks which came on some cheesy polenta. I would definitely recommend this restaurant!!!"
Intermezzo Carmine,Jordan M.,"Exactly the experience I expected from a nice evening out at a nice-looking place such as this.
We were greeted warmly and told to sit wherever we want and we got a nice little table in the corner by the fire outside. The menu was fairly small, especially for food, which I actually love! The options were quite wonderful and I could've ordered nearly anything on the menu.
We opted to start with ""The Dark Heart"" for the cocktail and a glass of wine. Both were excellent. Our appetizer was three little fried risotto and cheese balls that were delicious!
For a main course we got the pasta with Wild Boar Ragu and goat cheese along with the Pesto Risotto topped with New York Steak. $14 and $18 respectively. Great value at such a place like this.
For dessert I got a tiramisu which was exactly what you would expect from a high-end tiramisu so it was nothing impressive or unique but it was very good. I could say the same for the crème brûlée. It was your standard crème brûlée but it had a really really nice taste. Everything here was done very well and the evening was wonderful. The two servers that continually took care of us were wonderful as well.
Not only was it a wonderful experience but it was a pretty good value I think. The bill was less than $100. I'll be back!!"
Intermezzo Carmine,Bernie L.,"This place is, in reality, a 4.5. I can't give them a five because they're not unbelievable, but they're still really really good!
We went there before heading to an event and while the food portions are small the price is reasonable enough you can order a few things. I had the Arancini, which they often run out of. They were fantastic. Though I love a good riceball.
Moving on to the next course I had the Fettucine carbonara. Delicious. Small, but great. Same with the cherry duck confit with polenta. Fruity, delicious, wonderfully cooked.
The tiramisu was also great, though other people I was dining with thought it was too strong.
Service is great, though we were there on a slow night. Still, I get the feeling service is always good.
A hidden gem not too far from the stadiums. I will definitely be back."
Intermezzo Carmine,Cara L.,"I can't believe we waited so long to return to Intermezzo Carmine. But we finally made it back and I'm so glad we did!
I didn't go with a cocktail this time because I just wanted a glass of bubbles. But my late night dinner special of spaghetti and meatballs stuffed with mozzarella was delicious. At first glance I thought it was a little light on the portion size. But after eating I was sufficiently satisfied.
We also started with the sausage stuffed olives and they were very good! My only not would be I wished there was a sauce on the side. The olive and sausage combined was so rich that a it needed a tomato sauce or something similar to cut that richness. We still finished them and they were still darn tasty."
Intermezzo Carmine,Megan R.,"Wow, I loved this place! We came in after a Yelp event and it was perfect because they weren't too busy. I have been trying to eat here for like a year! But they are either always packed or we come on Sunday and they are closed on Sunday.
So this was our lucky day! We sat up at the bar and our bartender was wonderful the whole night.
We started with the anti pasta. It was delish. Full of yummy veggies, some meat, cheese and bread. For entrees we ordered shrimp risotto and carbonara. Both entrees were excellent! The shrimp were wrapped beautifully in prosciutto. The carbonara was just as lovely and my fav out of the two dishes but not by much b/c they were both so good!
The ambience in here is beautiful and sexy. It's a great place for a date night or for a more intimate night out with friends.
I love it here b/c it's really reasonably priced, unpretentious service, cool sexy vibes and delicious food. We had such a great night and I can't wait to come back!"
Intermezzo Carmine,Paulina H.,"Randomly found this place and saw the lovely design and decorations, it's so beautiful and arrogant. I went around 2:30pm, so it's not busy. I ordered Carbonara, it tasted bland and a little too much black pepper, egg over cooked so I can't make the yolk leaked. However, I do the taste of this dish, so I would still recommend this. The chop salad with steak is also a good choice, steak is medium rare and cooked perfectly. Everything taste perfectly together, especially with avocado! Highly recommend the salad. I will definitely go back and try other things.
Food: 8/10
Service: 9/10 (since it's not busy hours, the servers were mostly talking and didn't really come check on us)
Environment: 10/10"
Intermezzo Carmine,Melody L.,"Definitely a cute, intimate place to share a drinks and eat a meal with friends. They don't have a wait list and it's first come, first served. You have to keep an eye out for a table.
Upon entering, I was in awe of its decor and atmosphere. My friends and I didn't order any drinks, but it seems like their drink selection is pretty vast and reasonably priced. We each ordered a pasta, which was on the smaller side in terms of portions. The pastas were cooked perfectly al dente and the noodle to sauce ratio was pretty good. We also ordered an appetizer to share (the risotto balls), which was only okay. The risotto tasted more like thick white rice.
Service was good as well. Great place to check out if you're not too hungry and looking to catch up with friends and/or have an intimate date night!"
Intermezzo Carmine,Erin J.,"As my friend said ""this place is so civilized."" I'll call it approachable fancy. It was certainly upscale but not intimidating at all. Gorgeous decor that's cozy yet airy at the same time... I could sit there all day.
We had a bottle of white and the kale Caesar with chicken and the fettuccine carbonara. It was all amazingly delicious and I'll likely find my way back next time I'm in town!"
Intermezzo Carmine,Johnny L.,"Intermezzo Carmine
A lot of goat flavor in their arancini when it has parmesan, mozzarella cheeses, wild mushroom filled inside risotto bites.. indeed done perfectly.. but the goat taste overpowers the piece
Chicken Parmesan is very light in flavor.. needs more seasoning (nms)! Bread nicely toasted, great fresh basil n melted cheese.. came w/ a pear salad but I am not here 4 that
Welcoming environment, just needs less goat taste n nms!"
Intermezzo Carmine,Karen Z.,"This place had a very charming ambiance, and the service was excellent. I came here on a Tuesday evening and ordered:
- 1/2 a portion of the green grilled salad (5/5): Super fresh, packed with lots of tasty veggies. Great starter!
- Steak tartare (3/5): This was tasty, but the steak was at times difficult to chew.
- Prawn risotto (5/5): Incredible. The prawns were amazing! They were grilled and wrapped in prosciutto -- very tender and perfectly seasoned. The risotto was very well done as well.
Overall, had a great dining experience but the quality of the steak tartare kept it from being five stars -- wish I'd ordered another dish instead!"
Intermezzo Carmine,Nupur M.,"Came here for a weekday lunch. Loved the interiors. It wasn't too crowded and we got seating immediately. It did not have many veg options. We ordered the arancini, the fettuccine carbonara without any meat which was good. Loved the poached egg on the top. The arancini was okay did not like it much. Loved the tiramisu. The creme brûlée was good."
Intermezzo Carmine,Sebastian T.,"Upon wanting to explore all the cocktail bars in the Seattle area, Intermezzo Carmine not only offered cocktails but also Italian food. I went with a friend and decided to give it a shot! The space was a bit small, but it had a relaxed upscale vibe. This would be a great spot for ordering just cocktails without food as well. I'd love to come back in the summer as they have a nice outdoor seating area too.
The drinks and the food were at a typical upscale price & portion. I tried a cocktail, the glazed duck confit & the spaghetti Nero.
The cocktails were great, and exactly as i would expect at this price point. No qualms here!
The glazed duck confit as average at best, the cherry glaze didnt seem to compliment the flavor of the duck very well, and parts of the duck was overcooked and dry.
The spaghetti Nero was fantastic, it was an interesting touch to add the smoked salmon, as it was my first time having smoked salmon with the pasta but it strangely complimented the flavors well, the smokiness blended with the tomato & the creaminess seemed to blend right in with the flavors of the pasta.
Overall, it is a bit pricey for what you get, but given that this is finer dining, it was a satisfying experience. I wasn't wow'ed enough to come back again, but i would recommend coming by at least once to check out the space!"
Intermezzo Carmine,Shoa J.,"Absolutely horrible experience. I had my birthday here this past weekend and after confirming 3 times over the phone on where we would like to be seated, we didn't get the table we had requested and they put us on a table for 6 when the reservation was for 8 (the server did acknowledge that the reservation clearly called out the specific table we had requested). The way we were now seated, I had one friend just sitting by himself cut off from the rest of us.
Our server was rude and just not mentally present. Our drinks took forever to come, I had to reorder my wine twice since the server was spaced out. They even picked up my pasta before I finished it- by far the worst service I have ever received. All of us agreed that we would never return to this place."
Intermezzo Carmine,Savannah S.,"Love Intermezzo!! Such a solid, cute bar with awesome cocktails and great bartenders!
I've been twice and love it. The pasta is delicious (I mean Carmine's, their formal restaurant is AMAZING) so it's no surprise. The drinks are creative, fun, and use high quality spirits.
The space is beautiful, chic, and one of the many great spots in pioneer square. I love the bartenders- so fun and personable (got free tequila shots last time!)
Highly recommend for a casual meal with good drinks!"
Intermezzo Carmine,Molly M.,This place was one of our favorites on our trip to Seattle! We just stopped in for a cocktail during a walk (but brunch looked good too). We were attracted to the openness of the restaurant. There was plenty of space to have a private meal and tons of natural light. The cocktails were very unique and super tastey. Not too sweet which I always worry about. The bartender was awesome and gave us plenty of recommendations for Seattle and Portland. I wish I got her name because my boyfriend and I sat and talked with her for over an hour and actually enjoyed it. Highly recommend!
Intermezzo Carmine,Rosa K.,"First of all the ambience and the décor of this place is amazing. It is perfect for a girls night or date night- with wine and cheese (you can't go wrong with the antipasti, salumi and the oysters).
One of my favorites is the fettucine carbonara. I've had the lamb chops and the bone marrow which were really good too. These are all really rich, so make sure to order a drink with it!
The dishes are all pretty small so whenever I come here, we order a couple of dishes so we can try a little of each."
Intermezzo Carmine,Mikall D.,"Wow - the atmosphere and service was impeccable. Professional, attentive, and kind staff. Certain food items were delicious , others were just okay..which is the reason for a deduction of 1 star. I will likely go back and try some different items ."
Intermezzo Carmine,Amanda C.,"Was quite disappointed with this place. FYI I came for food and not drinks, so can't comment on their cocktails. I thought the squid ink pasta was very average, the pasta was cooked longer than al dente, and the portions were small. Flavors were there though. The arancini that my friends and I shared was also just okay. The risotto inside was really bland, and I could not really taste the mushrooms."
Intermezzo Carmine,Rian F.,"Great food, smaller selection than their parent restaurant. Had dessert and drinks. The creme brûlée was awesome! My wife liked the tiramisu as well. Only thing is that the place is a little loud."
Intermezzo Carmine,Irina B.,"A really underwhelming experience here given the excellent reviews. The food was bland and nothing special, and the service didn't help either. The arincini was really disappointing - it didn't have a crispy crust and tasted like plain rice, no flavor or seasoning whatsoever. I also had the grilled veggie salad which tasted fine but it wasn't anything special. My friend had the bucatini, which apparently was good but not great. Portion sizes are on the small side but I think the prices reflect that. Prices are pretty low for the location and ambience (the decor was nice) but you can get way better tasting food for the same price elsewhere.
Our server was dismissive and cold from the moment we walked in to when we left, which didn't help the mediocre food. Would not come back."
Intermezzo Carmine,Bo P.,"Keep in mind this isn't a general rating, but a subjective one based on my experience and dish alone :)
I've been to Intermezzo a handful of times for happy hour, but this was a different experience. Our waiter was incredible. Friendly, attentive, but gave us our time/space to catch up with the friends that we were with. We were waiting for the birthday girl to show up, and he was genuinely patient as he continued to bring out plates of bread to keep us preoccupied.
The fettucini carbonara was honestly perfection to me. The noodles were al dente, there was just the right amount of pancetta, and the poached egg's consistency was just as I wanted.
The waiter (I wish I got his name!) comped a tiramisu on behalf of the birthday girl, and while we told him it was OK, he insisted, and we obliged. And we were so happy that we did. They say it's a delicious 100-year old recipe and it tastes exactly like that. Best tiramisu I've had to date."
La Rustica,Kristin B.,"It is a small hole in the wall restaurant that is easy to miss, but is sooo worth it. The food is among the best Italian food in the city. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for something new or off the radar.
I had the chicken parmigiana and a caesar salad. Both were delicious. The chicken parm was perfectly cooked and moist. The sauce was amazing and tasty. The serving sizes were ample and more than enough for a single person.
I highly recommend this restaurant.
Accessibility: This is a very small restaurant and it is not too accessible. The washrooms are up a step or two and squeezed in a corner. The tables are all squeezed together. There is no room to sit and wait for a table. The good news is it is all tables and chairs. If you are able to work with a tight squeeze and a place that can get noisy because of the smallness of the space, then you're good to go."
La Rustica,Kira T.,"Delightful. Cozy and intimate, with excellent service. The location is quite special - right across from tiny Weather Watch Park in West Seattle, with its breathtaking, glorious views.
The lamb shank special was ""to die for"" according to my friend who ordered it (I don't eat meat). My penne puttanesca was spicy and bracing and packed with flavor. We shared bruschetta and a caprese salad that featured superbly fresh, amazing mozzarella (although the tomatoes were a bit pallid... I blame the time of year). A couple of our party ordered pizzas. One pronounced his ""just fine"" and the other (my husband) thought his was flavorful, but ""too bready."" He's from NYC, so he likes a verrrry thin crust.
Dessert was amazing: the four of us shared a regular and a limoncello tiramisu. Both were HUGE. Both were tender and fluffy and delightful, and neither were cloyingly sweet. The flavor of the liqueur and cream shone through.
WARNING: do not trust the prices posted online! Most items on the menu were between one dollar and four dollars MORE than the online price. We still got out of there for $250 bucks for 4 of us - including 1 1/2 carafes of their decent house Montepulciano and tip - but we were expecting it to be a tad less.
That said, I would return."
La Rustica,Jessica R.,"Best pasta spot in West Seattle, hands down! This spot is a tiny little spot on the west/south part of Alki, and definitely worth making the trip.
We have come here several times now, and most recently for my birthday. We had a group of 12 and they were very accommodating to have such a large group in such a small space. This time I got the rigatoni con ricotta, and that is probably one of my favorite dishes here. It's a rigatoni noodle with white sauce, cheese, onions, and pancetta.
They also brought me a birthday tiramisu! Overall love this place and will definitely be coming back!"
La Rustica,Lexi H.,"West Seattle institution with family-owned environment and hearty Italian classics.
The restaurant is located in a neighborhood with plenty of street parking right in Alki. La Rustica is quaint with some old-world Italian decor and white tablecloths - really what you envision when you think ""family-owned Italian restaurant"" so I was into it.
We arrived with a large party for a birthday (reservations made). For a Wednesday evening, it was very busy so I would recommend making reservations. The space is not big (inside or out on the patio), so I don't think they host large parties often. They sat us quickly, and started taking drink orders. They almost immediately brought us water and bread.
After taking our food order, service seemed to slow a bit. We had a late attendee, and they were not acknowledged until we finally caught our server's attention after 15 minutes. It was difficult as the service was great up until this point, and we seemed to have lost our server between ordering food and receiving food.
When the food arrived (which did take a while, but it was a big party and I won't dock points for that), I had to leave for an appointment so I got my pasta to go. I had ordered their squid ink pasta special. It was alright, but I'll likely get something else next time (everything else looked amazing). It was described to have a marinara/alfredo creamy sauce and the sauce didn't seem creamy to me, so I think I may have had different expectations - it was a very large portion, the pasta itself was good, and it had lots of seafood in it. The pastas are also served with a dinner salad - the homemade dressing on those were AWESOME - very garlicky and generously topped.
They serve wine by the carafe for a good price, and the food menu is large enough to give plenty of variety. I will definitely be coming back, this time with a much smaller party, to try out some of the other pastas that looked decadent and have a more intimate experience. I imagine that my star rating will go up after going with a smaller group.
Note: they can't split the check but can take up to 3 payments on a check, so keep it in mind if you're with a big group."
La Rustica,Jan C.,"Although there are some positives about our experience here, we will not return.
Pros: Our server, Nadia, was very personable and helpful.
The antipasto mista plate was huge. Good vairety of meats, but only one kind of cheese.
Setting is very nice
Cons: The noise level is not conducive to a pleasant experience. I used my phone to check the decibel level and it was pretty steady at 80 db with times up to 87 db. Not fun!
While the wait staff was pleasant there were apparently not enough of them as there was a lot of waiting for water, etc.
The food was underwhelming. In particular, the carbonara was dry to the point of having very little flavor. I am a carbonara fan and I don't want it to be soaking in sauce, but there was almost no sauce at all on this dish.
Parking is difficult to find during the dinner hour."
La Rustica,Aleksandr F.,Not sure about how is food here. We did not have a chance to try it. Came to this restaurant in 15 minutes after opening but owner told us that no free tables for us and we need to wait 20-30 minutes for it. We've waited about 1 hour but couldn't wait more and came out hungry. So book table before you going to come here.
La Rustica,M T.,"My husband and I came here for a date night and it did not disappoint! We waited about 30 minutes for a table and it was worth the wait!
I had the lasagna and it was delicious and so hearty, everything pasta should be! My husband had the chicken parmigiana and loved it. We wrapped up the night with the tiramisu, which was just delightful! The meal overall was delicious and the service was great. Food was the closest we've had to pasta we had on our honeymoon in Italy.
Come here and enjoy!!! The wait is worth the amazing food you get and the ambiance."
La Rustica,Sheila G.,"I wanted to love this place, and I did, until later that night when I got sick from the food!
The restaurant is so beautiful if you sit on the patio. The food is really good. But I wouldn't eat there after what I experienced after, they definitely served me some bad food.
Plenty of people have been there without getting sick, but plenty of people have gotten sick too. Go at your own risk!"
La Rustica,Aaron F.,"We had our first meal at La Rustica. A cozy, welcoming atmosphere, similar vibe to a rustic country home in Tuscany. The service was excellent, courses served timely, and just the right amount of attention. The lamb gnocchi, while tender and well presented, was too heavily salted. My partner had the shrimp scampi, which we both agreed was also too salty and grilled shrimp slightly overdone. The last critique would be the cannolis we both had for dessert, which would have been a joy to my Italian grandmother had the chef decided to leave off the discordant note of raspberry drizzle. That said, the wine, coffee, appetizers, salads and service were superb. We'll try it again at some point and see how it goes."
La Rustica,SI G.,"This place has really gone down hill. Canned mushrooms, terrible marinara pasta, canned whipped cream and ridiculous prices. They asked if we wanted to upgrade the salads to Caesar and then charged full prices for the salads that were supposed to be included in with the specials. Then they charge another $5 for anchovies. Will never go back. I gave it two stars instead of one because the waitress was attentive and friendly."
La Rustica,Michelle L.,Really cute place tucked away on Alki Beach. I don't know why there's so many bad reviews on service our server was super pleasant. Loved their garlic bread and salad - but next time I would skip appetizers only because you can't NOT eat a decent amount of garlic bread which fills you up. By the time our main courses came out I was like 60% full haha! I thought their full carafe of house cab sav for $38 was quite reasonable. Loved the bolognese pasta and my husband's lasagna was great too! Would definitely come back for sureee!
La Rustica,Nancy W.,"It's been probably three years since I've been here but love it just the same. Took a friend of mine who had never been and she was in love with the place. They take no reservations so you need to get here early or be prepared for close to an hour wait. Tonight they opened at 5, we got there at 5:15, being told already that there was a 45 minute wait. Fortunately, we got called about 20 minutes later. I ordered a cosmopolitan which was great and we ordered the calamari appetizer, I ordered the lasagna with bolognese sauce and she ordered the chicken parmesan. Because of the wait at our table for service and then for the meal, we got a complimentary salad which was very nice. My drink was excellent but then there was very little meat in the bolognese sauce of my lasagna and that's primarily what I was getting it for. Not only did the wait person take it off the bill, but gave us both complimentary desserts. I wouldn't hesitate to go back. Very small setting and very warm and cozy. Menu has excellent choices as well as the wine list and cocktail menu. This place is worth the wait!"
La Rustica,Lex D.,"Amazing food and service. Get the wild boar you will not be disappointed. Everything is fresh and made to order. Be careful loading up on the bread, it is so delicious you'll forget you have a meal coming. Unless you get there at opening you will have to wait a while. They do not take reservations. Wish they would especially for special occasions. When being seated ask not to be seated at the table near the restroom. Awkward when people are standing waiting to pee as you try to dine..and reminds you that you are near the toilet. They really need to eliminate that table. There is a little bar in back by little I mean it accommodates about 7 to 8 very tiny space. Again if you're not there at opening your wait will be over and hour. Worth a try if you dont mind waiting."
La Rustica,D D.,Quaint and delicious! Pleasantly off the beaten path and a great gem in West Seattle.
La Rustica,Elisabeth P.,"We were lucky enough to snag a table at this happening place on a perfect Seattle Saturday evening. We'd actually had reservations at a different restaurant to celebrate our first year wedding anniversary, but were unable to eat due to their inflexibility with my food allergy. The husband searched restaurants near us offering gf menu items and we discovered La Rustica.
Located down near the water, it has a beautiful view from the patio. Parking was a little tricky, but we enjoyed the walk along the water to and from our car. This family owned place is about as authentic as it gets. With the owner greeting guests and standing outside beckoning passerbys into his establishment, family as servers, and family in the kitchen, you immediately start to get in the mood for a home cooked meal.
We were put on a waiting list for the busy Saturday night rush, but it moved quickly and we were seated outside on the little covered patio with hanging plants and a gorgeous view of the water. Our server stopped by and took our order. Not only was she able to point out their gf items, she also assured me they'd prep my food with allergy precautions, oooo yah bring me allll the pasta.
They have a great selection of gf items to choose from. We started with their house salad which was simplistic yet incredibly fresh and delicious. I went for the gf penne with ricotta which was basically a creamy cheesy bunch of goodness. The husband loved the manicotti he ordered and had nothing left to take home.
We stopped back again just recently and had another perfect dining experience. The husband got the gnocchi and I had the gf penne with a creamy tomato sauce and beef filet. We finished with a decadent chocolate gf cake..There was not a crumb remaining on our plates.
With delicious authentic Italian cuisine at a great price, excellent service, and an unbeatable view, we left fatted and happy and looking forward to our return."
La Rustica,Alina P.,"Definitely my favorite restaurant! Food is amazing! Service is great! A beautiful family owned restaurant, with the most authentic Italian food!"
La Rustica,Cole M.,"Good Italian restaurant in West Seattle.
I am normally critical of ""Italian"" restaurants and sometimes a glance at the menu will give me an idea.
In the menu we saw, Lamb is translated into ""Pecora"" which means Sheep. Lamb is ""Agnello"". One wonders why in this modern age, people do not use a proof reader or a decent translator. In any case...
We were seated by the corner window which offers the view of the sound and sunset. We were greeted by the kind owner, and served with fresh, warm, flavorful bread. I ordered an Italian beer and my friend a red wine.
We ordered the Calamari in umido and bruschetta as antipasto followed by Fettuccine alla Carbonara and Risotto Con Salsiccia e Funghi. I found the carbonara dry and bland, I couldn't taste the guanciale, nor the egg. My friend liked his dish. We did not have room for dessert, maybe too much bread...
Judging by the various reviews this place could be a hit or a miss. My suggestion is to go, perhaps not on busy weekends.
If you're out on a date or some romantic event, the table at the corner with windows facing the West, would be the perfect place to have dinner at."
La Rustica,R D.,"Let me start by saying that this restaurant has a gorgeous view. It's a cozy family run place that serves delicious authentic Italian food and the service was excellent too.
Upon arrival we were warmly greeted by the owner / host and showed to our table. We started off with some complimentary home made warm bread. For appetizers we got the caprese buratta plate and mushrooms with polenta. For our mains, we had the prawns risotto and Pollo buccatini pasta. Everything was fresh and delicious. The food was rich, but I am not complaining, it was delectable.
Against better judgement, we decided to order chocolate tort to share for dessert, and I am so glad we did. The chocolate wasn't too sweet and the consistency of the tort was spot on.
Overall - delicious food, friendly service, and gorgeous view. Highly recommended!"
La Rustica,Mel S.,"We had a late night dinner yesterday (Friday) night and I woke up this morning after the most glorious carb/fat-8-hour coma. The restaurant is cozy, the interior is dark and does its best old-world impression, but the food is delicious and the service is attentive.
Yesterday was a refeed day for me so I went nuts on carbs:
-bread: buttery, tasty, and addictive. If you get bread straight out of the oven and not overly baked you'll have to practice extreme restraint from eating the entire basket
-calamari to start was refreshing. It isn't your typical fried version. It's almost prepared like a soup and can be spicy depending on how heavy handed the preparer is with the spices so beware. I piled my Calamari on the bread (bc carbs are life)
-I ordered the sepia spaghetti special with seafood made with Alfredo sauce. I love Alfredo sauce but it can get sickening if you overdo it. I barely made it through half my dish (bc I was carbed out and I wore tight jeans) but I'm convinced that this dish is amazing. I was disappointed in myself for not finishing the entire thing but I did my best and my husband will now get to enjoy the leftovers today (today is not a high carb day).
-husband got the Manfredo gnocchi (which isn't traditional gnocchi FYI). He loved the lamb but wasn't impressed with the non-traditional gnocchi.
-we also ordered a half carafe of wine which paired well with our meals.
No desserts were ordered, unfortunately. My pants just wouldn't allow it.
We will definitely return. I was told they take reservations for large parties so I plan to bring my family here for my brother's graduation!"
La Rustica,Gina F.,"Great food, great service, great location, reasonable prices. Family owned. Highly recommend"
Ristorante Picolinos,Cassie W.,"My absolute FAVORITE restaurant in Seattle. Their ravioli is to die for. The atmosphere is perfect and beautiful.
I love it. They do an amazing job."
Ristorante Picolinos,Brooke L.,"I am writing this review after many many transgressions with this neighborhood establishment. If you ask.. why did you continue to go to this restaurant if you have had numerous bad/awful experiences, there are only two reasons: one, some of the service staff were amazing; two, proximity to my house. To be honest, the food has always been mediocre at best and the restaurant is so poorly run that it's a 50/50 chance that you will have cold food, bad food, or an awkward run in with the owner and his ""managers"".
Over the last ten years, I have had my wedding rehearsal dinner there, hosted large birthday parties, assisted in a large wedding reception, and recommended friend to do the same. With the exception of my rehearsal dinner, every event has been tainted by large mistakes, hidden charges, and general dishonesty. Last Friday, I hosted my husband's 40th Birthday, mainly because of the easy access for my guests, and also I thought by ordering family style and an open bar would be hard to mess up. I was wrong. They insulted my guests on many occasions and gave us 1 member of their staff for a group of 30 people. This staff member worked so incredibly hard at serving, bussing, and bartending it was impressive. However, it made the experience feel stressful and rushed. I made the best of it because I didn't want to ruin such a monumental party with our closest friends, but I left with a bit in my stomach about how everything had gone down. Most of all the treatment of my guests. It was embarrassing to say the least.
I will NEVER return to this restaurant for dinner, and I recommend at the very least, you should avoid having any of your treasured life time events at such a mismanaged place.
10 years of keep their lights on at times, is over."
Ristorante Picolinos,Alec F.,"I've been Picolinos a few times before and have always been pleased with the food, atmosphere and wait service. Although my go-to dish of choice is usually the gnocchi, on this occasion I tried house made ravioli special and was glad I did; I can't remember the last time I had such delicious raviolis.
Not only was the food great, but the whole restaurant was transformed into a Christmas wonderland - I felt as though I was having dinner on the stage of the Nutcracker by Sendak.
The wine pairing suggested by the waiter went well with the ravioli... and my friend and I enjoyed the after dinner cappuccino, tiramisu and cannolis.
The only issue I had was that it seemed like the dining space was a little more cramped than normal - as every time the wait staff passed behind me, my chair would wind up getting bumped."
Ristorante Picolinos,Amandeep S.,"I've been meaning to write a review for a while because Picolinos truly deserves the credit.
This is by far the BEST Italian food outside of Italy that I have had. My husband and I have been coming here for about 5 years now - mostly for special occasions - and it's still one of our favorite restaurants.
We recently came to celebrate my husband's birthday here and had yet again, a wonderful time! I made reservations a few days before and we were seated on their patio, which is filled with lots of plants, beautiful flowers and some decorative statues. You don't for a second feel like you're in Seattle!
Our server greeted us right away - he was SO friendly and took good care of us the whole evening. We got their bread and fresh pesto, which they make in house. They have a different specials menu each day so we started off with a salad off that menu, which consisted of butter lettuce, nectarines, berries and pistachios - it was absolutely delicious! And perfect for sharing :)
For our main course, I ordered the Spaghetti Carbonara, which I had been craving for a really long time, and my husband had the Spaghetti con Polpette (essentially spaghetti with meatballs). I have to say that I wish the carbonara was a little more creamy, because it turned out a little dry for my liking. But my husband enjoyed it and his dish as well.
And since it was my husband's birthday, our server brought out a free tiramisu on the house, with a little candle, so it was a really cute way for the restaurant to help us celebrate :)
I can't rave enough about this place, and am already looking forward to coming back!"
Ristorante Picolinos,Marie B.,"Time for an updated review! It has been nearly two years to the day from my last visit to Ristorante Piccolino's.
This is a long time Seattle favorite in the Ballard/Sunset Hill neighborhood. Established, polished, refined, but without the stuffiness. Often a reliable spot for celebratory get togethers, socializing at the bar, family meals, and date night. It also has an adjacent bakery and cafe and expansive terrace area.
Three months ago, tried to dine with the MKE Yelper in search of tiramisu. But the entire restaurant was closed for a film shoot with Hollywood stars TS and MS. Can't divulge this as it is a work in progress.
Returned this evening (9/15/19) with The Homie and was lucky to find nearby street parking and snag a two top without prior reservations made. With two newish establishments across the street, Samara and Baker's, parking can be a bit of a challenge.
From the host, our waitperson, and support dining staff, highly attentive service is provided. Menus, ice water, wine list, and bread service are provided upon being seated. Towards the end of the meal, another waitperson came over to say hello. She remembered us from visits 2 and 3 years ago!
We started with the Antipasto Misto Classico ($16), a generous array of marinated/grilled zucchini, peppers, mushrooms, artichokes, tomatoes, olives, assorted cheeses and meats.
The Homie surprisingly went with a generous bowl of Rigatoni Salsiccia ($22.50) versus his usual Spaghetti Carbonara. Thick slices of Italian sausage simmered with a flavorful tomato sauce. Enough to box up that he will definitely have a delicious lunch tomorrow.
I ordered one of the featured dinner specials, Wild Forest Mushroom Ravioli ($23). Handmade ravioli with a trio of mushrooms in a cream sauce. I greatly appreciated that it was not heavy or salty. I savored this at Piccolino's, but admit to finishing the remainder while writing this updated post, patting my chubby tummy.
Wrapped up dinner with an espresso ($3) and Cheesecake ($8) for dessert. Again, The Homie didn't go with his usual gelato, made from a very old family recipe.
Me - definitely the tiramisu, no surprise ($8). Wish the layers were soaked just a tad more in espresso or coffee liqueur though. Delicious nevertheless and savored slowly.
Yes, a definite culinary splurge in a lovely dining setting. Makes one's visit a bit more special. But added bonus for consistent and well polished service plus palate pleasing cuisine, this is worth every dollar!
Definitely recommended!"
Ristorante Picolinos,Julia A.,"My husband was really craving Italian one night and wanted to take me to this place - my favorite cuisine is Italian so I was excited right away, and rightfully so!
We arrived a couple minutes late from our reservation time, so it took about an extra 10 minutes for us to be seated at our table. Boy, were they BUSY the evening we came here for dinner! We didn't actually have the server come to our table to take our drinks/appetizers order until at least 10-15 minutes after we were seated. Most of the time, we would be very impatient at this point, but we did see how busy they were that evening and saw plenty of servers running around frantically, so we were okay with waiting. We ordered the Bruschetta di Pomodoro for an appetizer - absolutely delicious! We also ordered an appetizer off the specials menu (for the life of me I cannot remember the dish name) but sadly they were sold out of it. :(
For entrees, I ordered the Spaghetti Carbonara and my husband ordered the Spaghetti Con Polpette. The Carbonara was absolutely delicious. But I will say there are few restaurants that make Carbonara truly the way it should be made (sadly Picolinos does not make it in the proper way) but it is still very delicious. My husband also LOVED the Spaghetti - he loves lamb and I'm not a big fan of lamb. His comment to the lamb meatballs was ""it is very lamb-y"", haha!
We truly enjoyed our dinner experience here, despite the longer than usual (I'm sure) wait times. I'm excited to come back here again!"
Ristorante Picolinos,Thomas R.,"Picolino's back garden bar is the perfect weekend hideout when you're needing an escape from the noise and congestion that has become Seattle.
You may have already heard that Picolinos offers great pasta, especially their spaghetti carbonara, which is so good that if you stick some on your forehead, your tongue'll slap your brains out trying to get to it. Honest! I've eaten here many times (just never in the garden) and it has always been good.
Now, let's get back to that bar in the back.
The garden bar is only open on weekends during warmer weather, which is prime time to sit and sip and forget everything. Nobody's going to rush you back here. Have a couple of Negronis or some beer before moving on to wine with dinner like we did. Gloria Gaynor and the Village People are playing in the background. I love this place.
The super-friendly bartender on duty last Friday was a real kick. This funny guy never intruded, but made us feel right at home. Scruffy barman would make some clever remark while resting his forearm on his knee after propping up his foot on something behind the bar and we would all laugh.
I like a barkeep who acts like he owns the place (or maybe he does?) yet never gets pushy or tries to sell you on something. He never asked us anything stupid like, ""would you like a salad with that?"" or ""how is everything tasting?"" This guy is a pro. His only unsolicited questions were ""what'll it be guys?"" and later on, ""how're you doing?""
Although quiet and unobtrusive, he was always visible, so if we wanted something, we only needed to flag him down.
His bar service alone receives 5 perfect golden A+ stars.
Oh yeah, and the food is delicious, too. Did I mention the carbonara? You're going to want some of that.
I'm so lucky I can walk here and stumble home. You should get a lyft or a cab if you can't hoof it, but do come here and sit in the back bar. It'll be one of your favorite new spots. I know it's one of mine."
Ristorante Picolinos,Jenny G.,Our most favorite restaurant in the city. Warm and inviting and delicious food. Our go to restaurant. Even after our trip to Italy we thought the food here rivaled everything we had in Italy.
Ristorante Picolinos,Anusha B.,"Great service, good ambience and excellent food. One of the best Italian places I have been to in town.
Came here for my friend's birthday dinner and had an amazing time. He had a reservation for 8 people, and got a booking easily.
We wanted to get a seat outside, but they had closed the outside area due to the weather. That was the only bummer for us in the whole experience.
The food and service was excellent. They had an elaborate specials menu, and they also did a custom order of truffle oil pasta for my friend. The rigatoni, wild mushroom ravioli and gnocchi were super appetizing but the custom truffle oil pasta was amazingly delicious. We didn't order a wood fired pizza and desserts. But I'm definitely gonna try that in my next visit.
This place is nested in a residential area in Ballard. It was easy to find parking on weekdays. I am guessing this place is packed on weekends."
Ristorante Picolinos,Novani M.,"We had our wedding dinner at Picollinos. We loved our food and the ambiance was excellent. Loved the patio, even though we decided to have dinner inside. Everybody loved the place and their food.
The service was excellent. My friend is the pastry chef there and she made us the wedding cake which was fabulous. Thank's Vicky! Totally a cute restaurant and one of our favorites."
Ristorante Picolinos,Josh P.,"So this is a few months late as I recently decided Id love to give feedback on the places I've been to, both good and bad. Picolinos would fall under the GREAT category, If I lived down the road id be there 2-3 times a week if not more. However I have been there half a dozen times every time the experience is spectacular, ive recommended this place to so many.
Lets start with the atmosphere not your typical atmosphere very rustic and unique which I like, especially at night time. Great date night spot as it has a very romantic atmosphere, first time I was there I spent 3 hours on a date just enjoying this place.
The food ive had is incredible, would very much recommend the Margherita pizza as an appetizer and as for the entree I can only give a personal recommendation for the Pork Belly Ravioli as its the only thing ive ordered just with how good it is, I get it every time. Although others I have gone with have complimented how amazing their dish was so I can only assume their entire menu is just as delicious as the one I order is.
As for the drinks ive had, they make one of the best old fashioned around and I know my old fashioned. I have had a few of their wines as they do have a very extensive wine list.
With all that being said, I would highly recommend experiencing Picolinos for yourself, you will not be disappointed and this wasn't just a one time experience and review for me, ive been a number of times and im still blown away by this place, if you love Italian food, you need to check this place out."
Ristorante Picolinos,Cait R.,AMAZING! I wish I could give this place 10 stars! Definitely try the goat cheese/ricotta ravioli or the spaghetti carbonara.
Ristorante Picolinos,Savannah S.,"Classic Italian food in a beautiful setting with friendly service!
It has a true italian vibe and ambiance. The patio is beautiful!
The pizza is incredible!!! The pasta is similarly top-notch. Overall a large menu and wine selection. Would definitely return, especially for the pizza!"
Ristorante Picolinos,Kenny S.,"We stopped by here the other night on the way home from the locks. A word to the wise if you go in through the door to the most right, you have entered the breakfast and lunch counter and you don't spot that, they may tell you they are closed not realizing you came for dinner next door.
Once we got past that, we were treated by a friendly staff with more than the minimum of on duty folks.
Each of got a bread basket which is nice as some places charge extra for a few slices of sub par bread, not here.
Caesar salad was ample and nicely dressed.
If toy want traditional carbonara, they leave out the eggs, but still call it by the traditional name. It's good, but it isn't carbonara.
The other dish was a puttanesca which could have done with more traditional olives and capers but was still quite good.
Both dishes were ample and a good value for the price which made for left overs the next day.
Get there early as even on a week night it was busy."
Ristorante Picolinos,Bryce B.,"Reminiscent of the kind of Italian restaurants you'd find in homey NYC neighborhoods. Although quite roomy, it still manages to feel very cozy inside, with decor reminiscent of your grandmother's house. Service is friendly and personal, they really make you feel at home.
Sure, there are meat dishes on the menu, but this is a place that clearly takes its pasta seriously. You want to come here on a carb cheat day. Picolinos is, and deservedly so, known for their housemade raviolis. But realistically, you can't go wrong with any of the pasta dishes. The Rigatoni Salsiccia and Spaghetti Con Frutti di Mare are both outstanding. Even the pizza is pretty good, but it's best as an appetizer for a table of four. Not sure I'd make a meal out of just that.
Dessert? Tiramisu is top notch. I wouldn't bother with anything else when this is so good.
They even have live music on occasion. Wine list is dominated by Italian varietals and PNW selections."
Ristorante Picolinos,Ben W.,"Simply not restaurant quality. Pizza was flop city - cheese and toppings slid right off. Carbonara was under sauced and noodles were over cooked.
Unfortunate to pay $50 for this meal, and honestly dissapointed in the yelp community. There is no chance this place is 4 stars. Y'all need to tighten it up.
Only positive is the outdoor seating area.
Will not be returning."
Ristorante Picolinos,Tracy J.,"Wow. How do I describe Picolinos ... I have spent so much time at this restaurant with my family for quiet celebrations or to have a cup of coffee in their European style coffee nook.
Piccolino's is an extremely large brick building in a quiet Ballard neighborhood. When you walk in it is quite dark. The tables are set with heavy silver. The tables are dark wood, And restaurant is split up into 2 or 3 different dining areas which gives it a cozy, intimate feeling. There's also a full service bar.
But my favorite place to go is the outdoor patio in back of the building. It's a huge outdoor patio. It's also landscaped as a garden. There are potted plants everywhere and draping vines and flowers. I've never seen another outdoor dining space in Seattle that is so beautiful. It's like having dinner in someones garden. There's also a tented outdoor seating section with a Moroccan feel. Dark drapes and very spacious. If you can't decide if you want to dine inside or outside, that area would be a great compromise. At any rate, wherever you sit it will be an experience. As for the food, I would take the rating down to 4 stars. I haven't had anything on the menu that I really loved. The foods okay. I think their menu could be reworked to provide more vegetarian options. But we don't go there for the food. We go there for the atsmosphere."
Ristorante Picolinos,Ben C.,"Absolutely wonderful experience and some of my favorite food that I've had in Seattle. My girlfriend and I went to the restaurant last night to catch an early dinner before going to a musical. Though we had a reservation, we were given the option to sit either inside or outside, of which we chose the latter.
The outdoor garden is absolutely beautiful. It made me feel far removed from the hustle and bustle of actual Seattle living.
We each ordered a wine which was very fairly priced. Bottle and premium wine options seemed like a reasonable markup when compared to the normal 3-4x you see. My girlfriend ordered the pork belly ravioli and I ordered the special lamb ravioli, both of which were absolutely amazing. The pork belly ravioli was very rich with a non-overpowering amount of white truffle oil included.
Very happy to have eaten here and I look forward to my next experience."
Ristorante Picolinos,Shubhayu R.,"Went here for a friends birthday dinner. Horrible service. Waiter didn't take food orders until we had to walk up and ask for them to take it. Seated at 7:30, food order taken at 9:40 after reminding the server twice!! They misplaced the orders and came back 30 mins later going around the table telling them their ordered dish was no longer available. Guess the table next to us ordered and had the last plate ahead of us. The bill was never updated so we still payed for the original stuff. If u have a party larger than 2 avoid this place."
Ristorante Picolinos,Swagata R.,Horrible food and service!We went in at 7:30 pm and the waitor only took our drinks order at 8:30 pm anf food order at 9 pm. At 9:20 pm he told us half of what we ordered is not available. Food tasted bland. One or two of the pasta dishes tasted good.
La Vita E Bella,Piko L.,"""I'm so full but I must keep eating"" is the motto you leave with after dining here!
Everything here is delicious-- from their bruschetta to their seafood pastas, their pizzas and calzones, nothing disappoints. It's ALL good!
The place is great for dates or groups, and the cute orange walls really set the mood.
I can't wait to come back in the daytime for outside seating so I can get a good photo of this delicious pasta!"
La Vita E Bella,Valerie S.,"Delicious Italian food!
We ordered takeout since we wanted to eat at the comfort of our own place that was just beside the restaurant as I read that service could be better. I looooooove carbonara pasta and was stoked to see it on the menu w their homemade spaghetti. It had just the right touch of cream, bacon, and cheese. Mmm! Although I was eyeing the pesto penne, we went with the spaghetti de mare because my mom wanted something w seafood. That was light and scrumptious as well. If you're looking for a pasta wo cheese, that's a great choice! The mixed salad is as normal as any salad w oil and vinegar. Their tiramisu was so creamy and not too sweet. It was the icing on top of an already totally above our expectations meal. If you're in the area, stop by for some homemade pasta. Your tastebuds and stomach will thank you!"
La Vita E Bella,Alex C.,"Ordered the pepperoni pizza, spaghetti carbonara, and ceasar salad for delivery.
The restaurant forgot our salad and delivered a mushroom pizza. Not sure what's happening behind the scenes at this spot.
They get a star because the spaghetti carbonara was on point, but otherwise the didn't leave an impression worth exploring again. Won't be back."
La Vita E Bella,Nancy S.,"The food and service here is just amazing!!! Came here with a friend on the recommendation of another good friend and I have no regrets!
I ordered their seafood spaghetti and was not disappointed- it had sooooooooooo much delish seafood on it!!! The portioning is very generous and the quality exceptional... can't wait to come here again!!!"
La Vita E Bella,Fraser C.,"I have been dining here a few times a year for over 10 years. The food is AMAZING and the service is great. Some of the best pasta in town!
The quality of food is very high and prices are reasonable."
La Vita E Bella,Francesco L.,I've been coming here for about a year and a half now and this place never disappoints. Great hours and great food. If your looking for some great Italian food in Downtown Seattle this place is a must
La Vita E Bella,Lana P.,"Super disappointing. Deserving good reviews brought us here for dinner.
Service sucks and don't mind little fruit flies all over your food. Food was very so so and I could not get out there fast enough to get away from those flies and dirty walls."
La Vita E Bella,Abhinav S.,"Had a crave for Italian food, and wanted to try out a new place. So this brought me to La Vita.
Ambiance:
It has a nice dim-lit casual atmosphere. Lunch and dinner is good here.
Service:
Service is alright. They don't do anything out of their way, or even try to be friendly. You're just a paying customer to them, that's about it.
Food:
I'm docking off a star because their bread... how do I put it mildly... is pretty bad, it's store bought! I mean it's literally the same as the $2 Trader Joe's bread that I buy. Even the cheapest Italian places have better bread. The garlic oil is decent.
Onto the main course, now this is where they shine. I had the Pesto Penne, and the pesto was super fresh, and just about everything about their main dishes, including the white sauce pasta is good!
Price and Portion:
Portions are hearty, no complaints there. Infact, mind you, the food is like super rich. Your heart will give out if you eat too much. Price is perfect too.
All in all, if you're willing to forgive their dismal excuse of a bread and look past that, everything else is great!"
La Vita E Bella,Sharon C.,"Came here to celebrate my friends' birthdays! There's plenty of street parking. Pretty good prices for pasta here. It was kind of cold, so we were planning to say we wanted to sit inside when the server asked us whether we would want to sit inside or outside. But he never asked...LOL he just seated us outside. I'm sure we could have told him we wanted to be seated inside instead, but we just didn't say anything.
Service was alright otherwise. The waiters were pretty nice.
Free bread! It's not as good as the bread at the Cheesecake Factory, but it was alright.
The presentation of all the pasta dishes we got was very nice! The portions are good for the price too. We had leftovers that we took home.
I got the fettucine tartufo ($18) which has Italian sausage, truffle oil, Italian sausage, and cream sauce. It's definitely on the heavy side, but I liked it. I would give it a 4/5. It's super oily though. Kind of felt like I was eating oil.
We also got the spaghetti di mare ($19), and we were impressed with how much seafood it came with. It comes with tiger prawns, mussels and clams, and they were really generous with the amount. And the price wasn't bad at all for a seafood pasta. The garlic flavor wasn't too strong, and this dish wasn't as heavy as the fettucine. This would probably get a 4.5/5!
The spaghetti carbonara ($15) was so good! Also a 4.5/5. But I really love carbonara. It comes with pancetta, and the spaghetti is so creamyyy. I would probably get this one if I went again."
La Vita E Bella,Stephanie L.,"I had the cannelloni. You read that correctly- that is not cannoli! Think enchiladas but Italian! The big noodles were smothered in bolognese and cheese. Every bite was heaven. The portion is great if you're really hungry. Otherwise lucky you, leftovers for lunch! This is one of the most amazing Italian dishes I've ever had. The atmosphere here is lively as well. I can't wait to go back. I'll try to get something different but something tells me I'll be getting the cannelloni again :)."
La Vita E Bella,Crystal F.,"We ordered takeout through GrubHub from this restaurant. The carbonara we received was clearly mad with whole eggs--there were chunks of gross undercooked egg whites throughout. We immediately contacted GrubHub who contacted the restaurant. The restaurant's response was ""we cannot guarantee the quality of the food"" and they refused to refund us for the inedible dish. Food wasn't good and customer service was worse."
La Vita E Bella,Janelle M.,Amazing customer service and delicious food! Stopped after driving by deciding Italian sounded good for lunch and we were blown away. Some of the best food we have had! Our family will definitely be back!
La Vita E Bella,Kayla K.,"I'll start off by saying that the food was good.
However, everything else was not good. I asked the server his preference between two pasta dishes. He suggested one over the other, so I ordered that. Our salad came out quickly, and then the entrees took forever. We were all very hungry by the time our entrees arrived, about 30+ minutes later. The entree given to me was not what I had ordered. It wasn't even the other pasta dish I had asked about. I told the waiter this and he begrudgingly took the entree away. It was not what I had ordered, why is that my fault? I thought that they would hurry to make the correct entree, but I was wrong. My family finished their meals and then my food was given to me. At this point, I had waited an hour total for my entree. I asked the server for pepper flakes, he never came back with them. I had to ask two more times before they were brought to me.
Then, the receipt came. We were charged for the incorrect entree that they had initially brought out to me. The server seemed extremely annoyed that he had to fix the receipt. They not only tried to charge us more than we should have paid, but did not apologize once, or comp anything for the inconvenience. Not even my $3 soft drink.
A sorry would have gone a long way in this situation, but it never came. The whole time I felt like I was the one at fault. We will not be returning to La Vita E Bella."
La Vita E Bella,Joan S.,"I went on an excursion today with my dog and walk down second Avenue just to see what was down there and I went to this restaurant the food was amazing they allowed me to bring my dog in and sit at a table I had the biggest Caesar salad I've ever had in my whole life and the lasagna was enough for two people extremely fresh and they gave me garlic bread and a whole meal was $24. Really?
The atmosphere was very upbeat pleasant nice to look at maybe it was because of the weather outside but I would definitely take my friends there. if you go order the lasagna and they might even give you some garlic bread and bring your dog but you'll probably have to sit outside I was allowed to sit inside .this place ranks 5 stars restaurant,
You might also meet Giuseppe Forte the owner
Another fantastic meal at the restaurant today
Pasta dish with chicken sausage
Service amazing
Great experience
Lunch time today on a nice day !!!
All staff generally friendly go have lunch!"
La Vita E Bella,Maddie E.,"We discovered this place on Postmates and keep coming back for more. If you're looking for pasta, the carbonara is a MUST get. It's incredible. Their bread and salads are mediocre but I strictly come here for carbonara."
La Vita E Bella,Mary M.,Christmas Dinner was fantastic here! We got the tortellini and linguini. The noodles were fresh and delicious! We also had the sparkling wine and the olive bruschetta! They had forgotten about the bruschetta and quickly made it right by comping it! Would go back again and again! Definitely use Open Table and book ahead of time! We also tried the cannoli which was fantastic!
La Vita E Bella,Douglas W.,"Amazing service. They weren't super busy but seemed to be under staffed. Our waiter was juggling multiple tables but knew how to handle it. When he felt he wasn't visiting us fast or often enough he'd do a drive by and update us on where we stood. That small gesture makes the difference. My wife and I just took the time to have a great conversation about our vacation in Seattle.
Once the food arrive it was nothing short of AMAZING!"
La Vita E Bella,JC J.,"Service was great
Food was very tasty
Ambiance: terrible, my eyes are really bad, and the place is just too damn dark, I cant read the menu. Had to open my cell phone flashlight to read the menu. The pizza was good, but the sausage could have been more.. it was just sprinkled with a few shredded sausages... was just in the center of the pie.
Overall was good. I'd come again, but next time I will try to request to sit outside patio. 3 stars for now, I'll change my rating next time I come back."
La Vita E Bella,Edward S.,"La Vita E Bella is a nice Italian restaurant in the heart of Belltown. It has a really old school feel to it. In English, the name translates to Life and Beautiful, which is a good name.
The reviews were kind of mixed, but I guess I came on a good night. The wine list was good--I ordered some nice red. For the appetizer I had the Caprese salad--it was really good with nice, fresh tomatoes.
For the main course I had a cheese pizza. I thought it was really good. The crust was nice and thin and I loved the tomato sauce.
I will definitely be back"
La Vita E Bella,Victoria T.,"Wonderful Italian restaurant in Belltown. In town for biz and dining alone but treated wonderfully. Chianti excellent, house salad had beautiful tomatoes on it and pasta fettuccine tartufo (spettacolare!) enjoy this dining experience if you can. Beautiful dinner."
San Fermo,Arielle F.,"I want to eat my last meal at San Fermo and I want it to be their bolognese. Seriously, this place is amazing whether you are going on a date, entertaining out of towners, or just in the mood for a delicious meal.
A few tips:
1. Always start with the bread and salted butter.
2. Order the burrata.
3. Order the bolognese.
4. Eat EVERYTHING! (This goes without saying.)
If the patio is open I highly recommend sitting outside - it's magical with fairy lights strung all around and there are heaters and blankets if you get chilly. However, they also have multiple beautiful spaces inside so there's really no bad seat in the house.
My SINGLE criticism is I've tried a few of their desserts - most recently the goat cheese cheesecake and a panna cotta drizzled with olive oil - and I haven't been especially impressed. To be honest I don't usually make it to dessert here anyway so it hasn't been a huge issue for me but if you have a sweet tooth I would recommend checking going elsewhere (Ballard is FILLED with great dessert spots, I recommend Hot Cakes)."
San Fermo,Katha S.,"Best food in all of Seattle. BANGING! Never disappoints.
Have ordered both pasta and meat, has never been disappointment."
San Fermo,Klarke C.,"This review is based around my experience for Seattle Restaurant week.
We had a reservation at 7pm and were seated promptly at near the front of the restaurant. San Fermo is located in a small White House in Ballard Ave and has a very cozy feeling! Although we were there for restaurant week, we couldn't resist ordering the charcuterie board and the buratta. Both are must orders if you're visiting. From restaurant week, I had the ceasar salad, spaghetti bolognese and the panna cotta! The bolognese was phenomenal and seems to be an overall favorite. It's also on the regular menu almost daily.
Besides the wonderful food, the service was a highlight. Our waitress was just not knowledgeable about the food but gave wonderful recommendations for wine. Try to Cupertino if you ever visit!
I will for sure be visiting in the future"
San Fermo,Karen F.,"Decided to give San Fermo another try because the pasta. God damn! I'm so glad we did. This time we had a reservation at 9:30 pm made on opentable but when we arrived the sign out front of the restaurant said that it was closed. We ventured forth and went in and the hostess hadn't realized we were on the reservation list I guess, but she agreed to seat us and said that it wasn't a problem. Our server was very friendly this time. He never once seemed rushed and we were able to enjoy our meal and a lovely bottle of wine without feeling like we were an inconvenience to the staff. The pasta's were incredible again. The pasta with short rib and blue cheese was ultra indulgent. This time the chefs even gave us a complimentary dessert before we left, some sort of mousse that was delicious. What a change the service made to our experience this visit. Would return again 100%"
San Fermo,Sean G.,"Unreal FRESH and HOMEMADE pastas! This place was amazing and I will definitely be back and recommend to friends! We had the following and they were amazing!
Saffron Spaghetti Bolognese - pork, veal, rosemary, fennel, parmigiano reggiano
Unreal flavor from the first bite to the last!
Agnolotti del Plin - prosciutto cotto and goat cheese filling, nutmeg, culatta
These flavor-packed pillows were my favorite! Amazing flavor and texture
Short Ribs - saffron polenta, cinnamon, cloves, fried leeks, Demi glacé
The meat fell off of the bone and the polenta was a perfect match!
Bruschetta - smoked rockfish, squid ink aioli, pickled peppers, lemon oil
The smoked rockfish was SO FRESH and had wonderful flavors!
House Caesar - anchovy, parmigiano reggiano, red wine croutons
Smothered with fresh cheese and the anchovies had a nice salty taste!"
San Fermo,Michael C.,"While walking around Ballard and considering dinner options, my friend Joe and I walked past this cute Italian restaurant and checked out the menu. The top item on the Primi & Secondi menu caught both our eyes and we had to get some.
Built onto what used to be a house, there is the intimate front room, a gorgeous patio, and a deep back room as well. I feel all have their pros and cons, so if an option take the back patio, but sitting in the front room and seeing the open kitchen is also a treat.
The menu is robust enough so that anyone could find something, while not being so overwhelming.
From the Antipasti my friend and I decided to split the House Caesar. Really tasty! I really appreciated the whole anchovies that really added to the experience and made you know this place was legit.
While the crab risotto and grilled pork belly did catch my eye, we both got our own Saffron Spaghetti Bolognese. I love saffron, I haven't had good spaghetti in a while, and the mix of pork and veal really called to me. What we got was this beautiful plate of spaghetti covered in sauce and then with a wonderful layer of white cheese. It was very flavorful, and while the bowl isn't huge, the amount of food is deceptively filling. My friend Joe even had some he took for lunch the next day.
All in all a great experience from the staff to the ambiance to the meal itself. I would gladly come back whether with friends, on a date, or even on my own."
San Fermo,Mike V.,"The black negroni with black walnut is incredible. And peak autumn/halloween with the orange nasturtium. Can't wait to try the white aromatic sage negroni. The pair would be (tragically) Instagram heaven I'm sure.
They should give lessons in how to compose a ceasar salad. Bravo. And on a cooler blustery autumn day, throughout enjoyed the turmeric mushroom pasta at brunch.
Great service to boot.
Only knock, somewhat limited brunch menu!
For dinner, make reservations, or wait an hour. Simple as that."
San Fermo,Julie A.,"The one star is for the ambiance. It's a cute space in a great location.
The food was fine, not amazing, not terrible - unremarkable and overpriced. I don't mind paying $$$ for really good food but this was just not it.
The service was sub-par - maybe because our server was new (she wasn't knowledgeable about the menu) or maybe because they charge an automatic 20% service fee so there's no incentive to provide great service - the tip is guaranteed.
The worst part? The hostess, Meredith. From the first unwelcoming interaction when we arrived, to the last when we were leaving, she stands out as the low point of this entire mediocre experience. Meredith was so incapable of handling a ""stressful"" situation of people backing up in the waiting area that she lost all grace and was completely rude to her guests . Just a reminder to Meredith - you're not saving lives, you're seating people at tables. Get it together.
With so many other great options in the area, don't waste your time and money here."
San Fermo,Shanna L.,"First time here. 2.5 stars but rounding down for the reasons noted below.
San Fermo is situated in an incredibly charming house turned restaurant. The interior decor is warm, both in terms of vibe and temperature. We thankfully were able to sit outside for our meal because it was uncomfortable inside -- and the patio was lovely.
The food here is pretty good - but not sensational, and painfully overpriced for what it is.
We ordered 1 appetizer, 1 salad, and 2 entrees (the cheaper of the available options) -- and no drinks -- and spent approximately $100 out the door. That should raise your eyebrows.
Portions are astoundingly small in relation to the price. San Fermo seems to want to go toe-to-toe with the worst aspects of dining in Manhattan, despite being situated in Ballard. That said, I've had way more satisfying Italian meals in Manhattan at this price point...
$14 for one piece of burrata. Menu description suggests it is accompanied by a wondrous array of vegetables and flavors, conjuring images of a satisfying spread. It wasn't much more than thoughtfully assembled, surely with culinary forceps. Didn't even come with a small piece of crostini, literally. See picture.
$14 (I think) for a nectarine salad. Nectarine *wedges* were huge, and were barely dressed or accompanied by the other items listed that we looked forward to (basil, endive, mozzarella - for example) and so tasted more like a fruit plate than anything else.
Now for the entrees: got the Bolognese (which the waitress touted as the restaurant's most popular dish) and a squid pasta dish (I'm forgetting the exact name). The flavor profile of the Bolognese was not nearly as sophisticated as I would have hoped given its popularity. It really lacked any underlying element of freshness and was heavy and monotonous. It was also lukewarm at best when finally delivered to our table (see below). That said, the squid pasta was excellent and truly offered a window into what San Fermo can do extraordinarily well.
Again, very small portions in relation to the price. It's not just small plates and small amounts of pasta. San Fermo doesn't even give you the protein item you expect in your pasta in any meaningful way. The particles of pork/veal were indiscernible vis-a-vis the sauce in the Bolognese and were largely indistinguishable. And there were only tiny squid ringlets. The amount of protein in both dishes was laughable, especially at $22-24 each.
I'd say their entrees, relative to other similarly situated Italian restaurants in Seattle, are approximately 25% - 33% higher.
Worst of all, we waited nearly *FORTY-FIVE* minutes between the time we finished our first course and received our pastas. The waitress was unapologetic and made it seem like this was just a reality of their restaurant, attributing it to the size of the kitchen. If that's the case, do not come here hungry. The last thing you should experience in any restaurant is a feeling of palpable hunger.
Everyone around us had already received their food. It felt like they forgot our order and didn't own up to it, which is unfortunate given that it's a relatively small restaurant with a relatively small menu.
The waitress told us that it would be another 10 minutes (ended up being closer to 20) and handed us a what was probably half a sliced baguette as a consolation about 30-35 minutes into the wait, even though we didn't want it earlier when she offered it (that's another $5, by the way). A more genuine gesture in light of the circumstances would have been to offer a primi or a glass of wine on the house. Didn't happen, and clearly management either wasn't involved or wasn't concerned.
There is an automatic service charge on your meal - and the service reflects that. Our waitress did not refill our water even once. We had to flag her down at every turn; she maybe visited our table four times of her own initiative, twice for greeting/taking our order and once for (expeditiously) bringing and returning the bill: the only fast part of the experience - a telltale sign. (Someone else brought our food.)
The most insidious part: San Fermo assesses their service charge BEFORE assessing tax, whereas most restaurants imposing a service charge do so as a separate item in lieu of gratuity. So, you pay tax on your tip, too. And the lackluster service was the cherry on top.
Sadly, we were here for a special occasion. The restaurant knew that in advance based on the reservation and even called my fiancé beforehand -- and they did absolutely nothing to enhance the experience.
We genuinely felt awful leaving the restaurant, despite the fact that it was supposed to be a celebration. We just moved to the neighborhood and were really hoping to love (and frequent) this place. Alas..."
San Fermo,Tami G.,"Popped in here on a Monday eve with no reservation and a party of three. They were happy to seat us outside on the adorably Romantic
Patio they have and couldn't be more obliged to make sure we were cozy and warm multiple times throughout the evening. The wine selection was wonderful and there were multiple GF options for me and the server was very informed and accommodating. It was a great experience- would eat here again and super glad we popped in."
San Fermo,Wei H.,"Having moved from Chicago, I whine a lot about how Seattle has no decent Italian food. Now I can finally say I have found my favorite pasta in Seattle. Friend and I got a glass of wine each, the endive salad, the carbonara, and the bolognese. The endive salad was fresh, crisp, and ideally acidic to work our appetite up. I loved the bite of the carbonara. The bolognese was just perfection in every bite. That meat sauce was complex and smokey and chunky and ahhhhh I don't even know what adjectives to use. If you eat meat, you HAVE to get this.
And yeah, the ambiance is quite cute and romantic, especially in the attic (roomy and airy, don't worry). But I am desperate enough to just go there alone to devour an entire thing of bolognese."
San Fermo,Kay N.,"I came here on a Friday night (they do accept reservations). This place is very intimate, cozy and relaxing atmosphere. It seems like they renovated a home into a restaurant. We got a corner table in the attic. Even though, I said the word attic, trust me, it doesn't feel like an attic. I like their light fixtures up there.
Their menu rotate daily with a couple of staple dishes.I ordered one of their staple dish, the spaghetti bolognese. My boyfriend ordered some kind of a seafood stew dish, like a cioppino. For appetizers, we ordered their antipasto board and got their bread and whipped butter dish (which is pretty good). The antipasto board had high quality meats and cheese and we were pretty happy with it.
I really liked my spaghetti dish, they made it really well. It was flavorful and the pasta was the perfect texture. My boyfriend liked his dish as well, but I think he wished he ordered pasta instead. I mean it is an Italian restaurant!
Overall, the service was great, pretty attentive. Great spot for Italian food in an intimate atmosphere."
San Fermo,Mitchell V.,"I've always said that I don't love Italian food. This is a personal thing I am dealing with it. I enjoy Italian food but I hardly ever crave it.
That being said, I have to admit I really did love this place. First things first, this place is really quite expensive. The pastas are easily $8-10 more than other places that also offer handmade noodles and sauces. However, the place is super cute (ideal for date night) and each room feels unique. The service is warm, kind and extremely helpful.
I really did love the quality of the pastas and sauce. The bolognese was great. I've had a lot of truly great bolognese and I really enjoyed this one. The dungeness crab bucatini was exquisite. A lot of seafood pastas will overload on garlic or cream to mask the not so fresh seafood but this let the crab shine. It had the right amount of lemon, butter and crushed black pepper to make a perfectly simple yet extremely delicious plate of pasta.
Also, I need to mention the Caesar salad. Wow. I love Caesar salads and I appreciate when they are anchovy forward (it is a fishy dressing, afterall). This was perfectly dressed with a wonderfully salty, fishy, anchovy-y dressing that will leave me thinking about it for some time. One of my favorite Caesar salads in the city, hands down."
San Fermo,Geana N.,"Our expectations were a bit higher for this lovely house restaurant with access to the Sunday market fresh vegetables and proteins. We're a bit disappointed in a the dishes we've tried so far.
Specifically the egg sandwich with arugula salad and the pasta dish (and I added a poached egg). The sandwich had more bread than filling and we found that a bit off putting even though the egg was nicely cooked and rich in of itself. The sandwich needed more protein to stand up to the richness of the egg, the thick bread, and the spicy arugula.
I had the pasta dish and while it was a good dish, I was not blown away by it like I thought I would be. It was a tad, bland. I wanted to like the dish much more but it was just ""good enough"".
The drinks were made well. We liked the mimosas and in fact ordered two each because they were really delightful for a sunny Sunday brunch. There is a bar here, and perhaps next time we just stop in for a drink or two.
One cool thing about the menu is that it changes weekly with only a couple items that remain as staples. Perhaps these dishes just weren't for us. We have visited twice now and have walked away wanting. We'll probably give the food one last try and if it's not great, we won't return."
San Fermo,Julia L.,"This is a cute and cozy restaurant. The exterior looks like a residential house painted in white. Once you step inside, immediately to the left is the kitchen. And to your right is a small town of seating, and there are more seating further in the ""house"" as well. The staff are friendly, but not overly so - you'll be left alone to enjoy your meal except for drink refills when necessary. I would recommend the burrata - very soft, fresh, light, and well complemented by the sweet & tart flavors of the diced apple plus balsamic vinegar. Additionally, the light and citric acid flavors of the burrata dish goes well with their housemade focaccia bread. I would also recommend the spaghetti bolognese. It's creamier than the typical bolognese sauce with savory and hearty pork + veal in each bite. For dessert, I tried their tiramisu. It's quite uniquely flavored with pumpkin mascarpone and cinnamon - personally, I wasn't a big fan of the dense texture of the mascarpone as the bottom layer of the tiramisu or the cinnamon mixed with cocoa powder flavor. Nevertheless, I had a lovely dinner experience."
San Fermo,Monya M.,Wow. I've always wanted to go to this restaurant. I won't be back. I came for a 5 pm reservation with 2 friends. We had a nice enough dinner. The food was good. Enough. But not over the top. When we stated that we were hungry but not starving we ended up with way more food than we indicated we wanted to the waitress. But all that aside - we had a lovely ambience. Until this extremely intense woman showed up out of the blue - whom we hadn't seen prior - and aggressively told us that we needed to move immediately as they had a reservation coming up and she stomped away. This was after we were at our table for a little over 2 hours. We were deep in conversation and were taken completely off guard. It was a harsh and abrupt ending and unexpected. We won't be back.
San Fermo,Nicole H.,"Pappardelle

This place definitely has that rustic Italian vibe. Its charms blend in perfectly with the historical Ballard feels. Great place for a date night or brunch date. The homemade pasta was fresh. The combination of wagu beef and bone marrow really intensify the beefy flavor. It was a interesting fusion. Keep in mind that the pasta is in Italian portion not American."
San Fermo,Marina K.,Had a great girls night dinner date here on a Friday evening. We got a reservation- I would def recommend it. We were sat upstairs in the attic which was super cute. I could see it getting pretty hot up there but there was AC units so we were good. I have been there 2 other times and didn't even know there was an upstairs. I've sat inside and on the deck which are both great areas as well. Our waiter Zak was the best! So nice and really took care of us. He Recommended the best stuff and everything was delish with our 2 glasses of rose. See photos for all the great things we got. Very good Italian dinner spot and I will def be back.
San Fermo,Kristin H.,"I'm updating to five stars. I love this place.
The decor in the cute little house is perfect. I love sitting on the patio. I love the pastas, but when I'm not that hungry, I love the appetizers too.
Perfect place to come eat in the summer (or during the rest of the year, really). One of my favorite restaurants in Ballard."
San Fermo,Tingting W.,"I checked this place out when I was walking around the Ballard farmers market. The outside of the restaurant was what pulled me in. It looks like a tiny house (super cute). I sat outside and it was all very hip. The food took a long time but it was worth it. The egg Benedict and the carbonara both tasted FRESH! With a first bite, you know it was not from a can. Everything was so amazing and I would love to come for dinner one night!"
Barolo Ristorante,Chandra D.,"I came here for dinner on a Saturday night with my husband while on a weekend trip in Seattle.
Great vibe and atmosphere! It was very busy and waiting in the lobby/entrance area is a little awkward. Most people didn't want to wait outside in the cold, but in the summer this would work--not so much on a chilly, misty October evening. It was crowded and I know when I'm eating, I don't want people hovering over me or bumping into me. If they can figure out the waiting issue, this would be great!
Our food and service was top-notch. We shared the arborio' risotto with goat cheese and basil, and I found it to be flavorful; each flavor profile was tasty. I enjoyed the salty goat cheese! The risotto wasn't mushy, either. It was tender and just right. I ordered the ravioli of the day, and it was also good. However, I really enjoyed my risotto.
Great food and great service!"
Barolo Ristorante,Maria M.,"I came here to celebrate my birthday and I was disappointed with both the food and service. The server seemed annoyed at any questions and also seemed to be in a hurry (it was on a Thursday so not very busy). He was not very friendly and came around twice or so doing just the bare minimum.
The grilled calamari ($16), had an excruciating charred flavor. My pasta, which was the ravioli of the day, tasted just okay nothing amazing. This was definitely my first and last time coming here.
I wouldn't recommend it."
Barolo Ristorante,Ibrahim A.,"I had a special occasion and decided to spend this occasion at Barolo. I was looking to try an Italian place and checked the reviews and decided to give it a shot. I called to make a reservation and informed them that this is a special occasion and they acknowledged my reservation and informed me that they will accommodate me with something special. I checked in with the host, the seated me right away as they were not busy.
Service
The service at this place does not meet an upscale restaurant service. They also do not do anything special for you like a decoration at the table or free desert if you have a special occasion even though they confirm that on the phone with you when you make a reservation.
Food
Starters
Ordered 2 appetizer dishes the tuna tartare and the Cheese Burata with mushrooms. The appetizers were the only thing that did stand out for the whole evening.
Main course
Ordered the ravioli with mushroom and the rigatoni with lamb. The rigatoni with lamb was a bit salty and did not meet my expectations. However , the ravioli with mushrooms was ok.
We finally decided to skip on dessert and call it a night. I would say that I was bummed that this place did not meet my expectations."
Barolo Ristorante,Tejashree M.,"This looked like an upscale restaurant with good ambience but the service I got was a bit disappointing. They left just a paper bill on my table without saying anything or asking for desserts. After asking, it took them forever to bring out the dessert. I was seated at a table in the bar section on a Thursday night.
The tapenade served with bread at the beginning was the only amazing item here. The gnocchi was okay and the tiramisu was decent."
Barolo Ristorante,Lakshmi V.,"I went to this restaurant with office colleagues and we had a good time.. I liked the food....ambience.. wine was nice.. beautiful.. vegetarian options are quite limited, I enjoyed the portion size. My chicken entree was yum.. couldn't complete the whole thing though ..ha ha ha. Overall a cool place for office parties and larger crowds. Service was good.. we were 20 plus people, everything was served on time. Salad & desserts are average."
Barolo Ristorante,Vivian L.,"Our favorite tables are the corner booths away from the bar (17, 15, etc.), or, at the far end corner of the bar itself--away from the chaos but enough to people watch and talk over date nights.
Foods
First time? Get the rabbit, it's their best stable dishes here. I never liked rabbit before because it always tasted chewy and drenched in gravy (typical French style). Here, the rabbit is juicy, tender, and with seared flavorings similar to a deep fried quail thigh. A creamy pasta dish. My favorite part was the rabbit's heart as I love organ meats and feel American meat recipes don't call for them enough.
If you're lucky to catch them on their lamb shank special of the day, get it. $35 and large enough to share, though I did see the fellow next to us finished up his.
Dessert
If you love cannoli like my husband, then you should get the cannoli. He seems to really like it.
The bread pudding is good, warm, prepared well, and on the lighter side. It's not your typical American bread pudding drizzled in caramel topped with ice cream.
Service
Outstanding. From hostess to waiters to bartenders to floor manager. It feels like family coming here. Not your pizzeria family, but your upscale cousin's family, haha. Whatever the case, this place will cheer you up on a bad day or the very least, not ruin your good days.
Price
Very reasonably priced. You get your money's worth here. The free focaccia bread alone is worth a visit. They always give us extra to bring home :), it's yummy. And I here their happy hour is one of the best in town. Will have to check that out!
Atmosphere
Classy. Family. Fun. Romantic. Italian.
No kids. Great!
No pets, either.
Location
Street view is The Westin's parking garage and Mc Donald's. It's almost like you've found a hidden gem."
Barolo Ristorante,Judi W.,"Came here with a good friend because we deserve a good meal after a long week of school AND it was a good excuse to try a new place due to Seattle Restaurant week.
ENVIRONMENT - Very very dim. I could barely make out the people's faces at far tables. It's a cozy setting and the place is quite narrow. But it was comfortable and snug in our booth.
FOOD -
Poached pear, mozzarella, with prosciutto - Simple appetizer which I thought was a good way to start a meal. I loved the combination of sweet (from the pear), creamy (from the cheese), and salty (from the prosciutto) flavor that were on the dish.
Italian sausage lentil soup - My friend got this one and I had a bit of it. It's quite sizable for an appetizer and there were good chunks of sausages in it. Good hardy flavor and it filled her up.
Squid ink risotto with baked salmon - I loved the risotto. It's a bit briny and salty from the squid ink but it was also creamy. One of my favorite parts of the meal was this. The salmon was also nice and tender. I overestimate my appetite sometimes so I thought this plate wouldn't fill me up, but it really did!
Chocolate torte - My friend got this one, and the presentation was nice! Simple and decorated with strawberries. The torte is a good amount and was rich in chocolate.
Cannoli - I thought it would be smaller, but it was pretty big! I was also stuffed at this point, so I was thankful the dessert wasn't too large. It was my first time having a cannoli so I don't really have anything to compare it to, but it's very heavy on the cream and the pastry bit was crunchy and hard. I still enjoyed it though!
SERVICE - Made a reservation for 7:15PM and we did arrive on time, but had to wait around 20min before being seated which is fine but ideally, would have liked to be seated sooner since we did arrive before our reservation time. But then again, it was SRW so I know they were packed! Service was good though! Very attentive and would always check in to see how we were doing and gave us good descriptions of the food when we ordered them. A lot of the words, we didn't know (due to our lack of knowledge on foodology terms or lack of Italian) so it was super helpful that the waiter told us what the dish consisted of.
Overall, I would come back to try their regular menu. It is kind of tucked away and the environment and space is a bit too narrow for my comfort, but the food was decent and the service was really good!"
Barolo Ristorante,Nan F.,"Updated review on 11/4:
They took one hour to sit us down (we were 4) even though we had reservations.
Then another hour to bring the food. I'm not kidding.
The quality of the food has diminished. And don't expect that the food will be consistent. I came back to eat something I like and in three occasions it was different. How is it possible? One day they add capers the other they remove them and make the sauce creamier (not good) and then the portions are a lot smaller but same price. I mean: come on.
I doubt I will be back. Making pasta is easy. How can someone ruin that?"
Barolo Ristorante,Tara L.,"My family was coming into town to celebrate birthdays and wanted Italian food. I came across this place and was able to place a reservation for 14 people within 2 week's notice. I like how they included the addition of ""happy birthday"" along with my aunt's name on the menu.
When we arrived, we were seated very promptly. The waiter we had was very friendly and the service overall was great. I enjoyed the bread with an olive tapenade was very good and was offered before dinner. For an appetizer, we just ordered green beans which was cooked and very flavorful with lemon.
For entrees, I ordered the carbonara. I liked that the dish had pork belly instead of bacon or pancetta like most carbonara dishes. The pork belly was cooked well and added a nice crisp. My boyfriend ordered the ravioli special of the day, which was potato and mushroom ravioli. I personally think his dish was better and would definitely recommend their ravioli.
Overall, I would come back here especially for their happy hour deals. Their pastas are handmade, which is always a nice addition. This place is also a cute date night place or great for parties."
Barolo Ristorante,Zermin A.,"Finally made it into this hidden gem in Seattle! Let's just say they have a hell of a happy hour menu! For the quality of food you get, the price point is a steal! We ordered the HH Rose and it was delicious! The grilled caesar salad I had here has to be one of the best I have ever had! The tune carpaccio was delightful and the service was outstanding! We loved the bartender, super friendly and attentive!
I will be back to try out the other items on their menu! Definitely recommend this place!"
Barolo Ristorante,Jessica M.,"Best place for carbonara! I LOVE pasta and this Italian restaurant in Seattle has a really creamy and flavorful taste in their carbonara which I love. Right after you get your entree you may think that the portion is too small but it's mainly because they use a large plate. It ended up getting me super full I couldn't finish it all. I also got a cocktail, which is probably why I got full too quickly. Some of my other friends ordered different pasta dishes and some said they didn't like it. I guess it just depends on what you get.
I came here for a friend's birthday dinner and the server we had took care of us pretty well. His enthusiasm was great and he was very knowledgeable of the menu. They even customized our menus and labeled ""Happy Birthday"" and put the birthday girl's name on it! Definitely makes you feel special lol."
Barolo Ristorante,Latifa S.,"Darn!!!
This place really went down hill. Such a shame. Everything went down. Had 2 extremely warm bottles of wine: even asked for ice. They kept it chill but it was the warmest wine. Seattle's been hot lately. And both bottles of wine tasted like they have been outside.
It wasn't as busy as it used to be in the past either. But our plates weren't cleaned off the table for a long while too. Should've set at the bar with Heidi! But we had a table. The tuna tartare was covered in onions. Way way more onions than there should be. Pasta was a ok too.
The worst was the wine. Warm bottles of wine!! Such a shame. I love this place. Haven't been back in a bit. But to see it go down in both food/wine and service is a bummer!!"
Barolo Ristorante,Thea W.,"Where do I begin? My husband and I have been here twice, first for our engagement dinner and again for my birthday just a few days ago. The first time we hit up Happy Hour- super good deals on the bar menu and drink specials. The service was good and the food was absolutely delicious. We ordered more than half the menu and were not disappointed by any of it- standouts were the ahi and the quality of the pasta. The server caught me staring at my hand and asked if I'd just gotten my nails done. Slightly embarrassed I told her We had just gotten engaged and I couldn't stop looking at the beautiful and unique ring my (now) husband had put on my finger. She brought out a chocolate desert at the end of the meal, complete with a fantastic sparkler candle to help us celebrate. It was very special and memorable.
Our trip two days ago was for the full dinner service. We were a group of 6 and they gave us a beautiful semi-private room where we managed to order about half the menu- starting out with many entrees as share plates before settling on individual entrees. Everything was absolutely exquisite. I wanted a different setting for my cut of meat which she happily accommodated. Standouts were the pheasant gnocchi, the rack of lamb, and the filet. All the meat was cooked just perfectly. I'm not normally a pasta eater but the freshness and quality of this pasta is undeniably delicious.
The server was lovely, helpful and very knowledgeable about the wines (impressive, even to the mother of all wine snobs at our table). She was very attentive without being overly-present.
On top of ordering half the menu, we ordered 4 bottles of wonderful wine and every desert. I can't say enough good things about Barolo. It was the best birthday dinner I have ever had and we will definitely be back.o"
Barolo Ristorante,Richard M.,"We went to Barolo, with a large party of 12 or 13, to celebrate a birthday and we had a wonderful time. It does a very good job at catering to special occasions.
When reserving the large party, the staff asked what the occasion was and we told them it was for a birthday. We provided them with the name of the person and when we arrived they gave the birthday girl a ""commemorative"" menu with her name and the occasion the top.
The server was very friendly and patient. Our group came slightly late and we didn't feel rushed to order/get things going while we waited for late guests. He came to our name several times throughout the service to make sure we had everything that we needed. It was nice.
The ambiance is perfect for a date night or special occasion, with the dim lighting and slightly upscale decor. It's a place where you could definitely come in wearing jeans and a t-shirt and be accepted, but also come in wearing dress attire and not be over dressed either.
The service, like most Italian restaurants, started with bread and some sort of olive oil-based dipping sauce. It was a little sweet, not my favorite, but it wasn't bad. The bread was good though, it had a little salt on top which made it easy to come back for more. We were a bit disappointed that we weren't offered more after finishing what was brought to the table, though I suppose that would've asked for more.
Of the many items on the menu, I tried one of the daily specials, which was a Squid Ink Pasta in a Pesto Sauce with Scallops and Salmon Roe and the Spaghetti Carbonara.
It was the first time that I had tried Squid Ink Pasta and I really enjoyed it. The pasta was al dente and had a nice salty, umami, flavor that you don't get with regular pasta. The pesto was light and refreshing and paired well with the pasta. There were two large scallops, I could've went for another, because they were perfectly cooked. I did expect a bit more Salmon Roe - and expected it to be atop the pasta, but it was scattered around the plate. Each bit with the Roe has a wonderful salty flavor. It was an extremely umami experience, between the saltiness of the Roe, Parmesan in the Pesto and the pasta itself. I would definitely order this again.
The Carbonara was a classic Carbonara. It was rich, salty, creamy and smoky. The spaghetti was cooked perfectly and the saltiness and smokiness of the pork paired really well with the creaminess from the eggs. Very good Carbonara.
After the meal they came with a small cake and a sparkler for a candle. It was pretty cool and a nice way to celebrate.
Also, it has a pretty robust wine list as well. Plenty of by glass, half bottle or full bottle options.
All-in-all its a very good restaurant, perfect for a date night or special occasion.
The only real negative is that it's a little expensive, but you could argue that's the trade off for the ambiance and execution for a large party. That being said, Seattle is filled with so many terrific Italian restaurant that serve just as food, if not better pasta, for the same price or less. But, if you don't mind spending a little money, check it out."
Barolo Ristorante,Jennifer L.,"I was here tonight for my birthday and I was very underwhelmed, my friends who came with me love Italian food and had no interest in this place at the end of the night. I will add that our server named Francisco was extremely rude and aggressive, he was pushing us to order quickly and was rude when we had any questions. Not only that but also he rushed us and he himself was rushed although it was not that busy. For such a large group as ours there should be more assistance and attentiveness given.
I will start with the PROS.
- This place is good for group and large parties especially when you're celebrating a birthday. They bring out a small dessert with a sparking candle on it and it's very special. (Picture below shows our own cake brought)
- the carbonara was very good!! And well made, it was buttery and had the right amount of salt ($23)
- one star was added for the ambiance and the romantic lighting
CONS:
- as stated earlier the waiter was extremely rude and distant, he brushed us off so much that everyone had to comment about it at the table (we do not normally speak of people like that)
- all the other dishes we had including the meat, lamb rag and the bread and appetizers were NOT GOOD.. there are definitely a lot better Italian places to fill the need for some good pasta and bread... this is not it.
This experience was low and I will not be eating here again, I think also the waiter ruined the night for us with his attitude. If you're going to eat here I think it's best to go for HH when the options are good for its prices. Also, you can expect quick service and for the waiter to brush you off more than you would for a sit down dinner with added gratuity."
Barolo Ristorante,Corey S.,"My husband and I visited Barolo for dinner with our friends on a Thursday night during restaurant week. It's a perfect spot if you're celebrating a special occasion; the low lighting makes it very romantic, and the food is high quality and prepared beautifully.
For our first course, three of use ordered the English Green Peas Puree' and Guanciale, which was rich, creamy, and probably my favorite item the whole night. I'm pescatarian, so I was delighted when they told me they could make any of the 1st courses vegetarian (they kindly removed the Guanciale). The 4th member of our party ordered the Speck And Mozzarella, Poached Pear (without the speck), and loved it as well.
For our main courses, my husband and I both ordered the Cernia alla Livornese with heirloom tomatoes and squid ink risotto, which was divine. We especially loved the squid ink risotto; I was worried might taste fishy, but it was the perfect texture and savory flavor. One of our friends ordered the Wild Boar Tenderloin Honey with juniper chanterelles, and he absolutely loved his dish! My husband had passed on ordering the boar because he was worried it would be too gamey, but it was cooked to perfection (seared on the outside and rare on the inside), and ended us wishing he'd ordered the same dish. Our 4th friend ordered the Raviolone with kale ricotta and local pumpkin puree and also finished off her dish!
For dessert, I was the only one to request the Torta Salame di Cioccolato, and it was amazing! The other three ordered the Cannoli, which I tried and enjoyed as well.
Our waiter was fun and friendly and joked around with whom I think must've been the manager, as he visited our table at some point in the evening.
I only have a couple small critiques; the first being that was a little loud and I had some trouble hearing my friends who were sitting right next to me. It also took a little longer for our food to come out than I was expecting. Both of these can be chalked up to it being restaurant week and they were serving a higher volume of people than normal (which is a good thing!).
Overall, I highly recommend Barolo for a high quality, fine dining experience!"
Barolo Ristorante,Kalpana R.,"The food here was overall 3.5 stars but the service left something to be desired for and hence rounding down to 3 stars.
I came here with a large group of colleagues and each of us ordered an entree and then we shared desserts. Some of us also got some beverages.They served us with bread and dip while we were waiting for the orders but that was never re-filled. Maybe that's the restaurant policy but the empty bread plates sat on the table for a long time which was weird and made us expect refills. One person was served a barely warm coffee which had to be sent back.
Our server told us to not look at the pictures on Yelp to decide what to order and that he would be the best person to consult if we had any questions about the dishes. This also was weird; I understand that restaurants make changes to dishes but outright telling us to not look at pictures was off-putting/patronizing. One of my colleague also asked if they could get their lunch earlier than others, which was also meet with another patronizing statement that it takes time to serve 10+ people. This might have been a misunderstanding that the server thought that they were asking for everyone's lunch to come out quickly but still the response could have been better.
Moving on to the food, my carbonara was great! It also was deceptively huge quantity; and I especially loved the pork belly. The other entrees had mixed reviews ranging from meh to not bad to decent. The tiramisu was also decent and so was the affogato, but the latter could have been better if they had added more ice cream and less of the whipped cream.
Overall, I might get food to-go next time but not dine-in because of the service."
Barolo Ristorante,Lexi H.,"Ahh, Barolo. What a complicated relationship we have. How do you always lure me into your late night happy hour?
Barolo is - hands down - my favorite happy hour in Seattle. 50% off bar food with $20 bottles of wine (red, white, or rose) is an absolute steal. They also have an excellent wine list outside of the happy hour, but the $20 bottles are always nicely selected and good for table wine. Happy hour is 3 - 6 p.m., with late night happy hour 10 p.m. - midnight.
The complimentary bread with an olive tapenade is reason enough to come here. I don't know how they are sent tapenade from heaven, but they figured out a way to import it, apparently. Man, it's good.
BUT, here's the real reason I get drawn into Barolo: THE BAKED ESCARGOT. Not sure if you like escargot? Trust me, order it, because you will. You get 6 escargots (removed from the shell) baked in a little muffin tin-like ceramic dish, swimming in a delectable butter sauce. Perfect use for extra bread - eat that lil' snail and then soak the bread in one of those little slots full of butter-ous harmony.
Other favorites: the grilled calamari is perfectly cooked and seasoned. The cheese plate is a crowd pleaser, especially if you have a not-so-adventurous friend with you. All of the pastas I have tried will hit that carb-sized hole in your heart (and stomach).
The location is intimate (read: the bar area is small) with a dark, but upscale, atmosphere. I have always enjoyed our servers and bartenders; very friendly and chatty. Note that it is next to the main Amazon HQ campus, so the early happy hour is PACKED Monday-Friday, so arrive early if you are looking to go then. In the summer, the small outdoor area is buzzing with Amazonians in search of the city's best happy hour, so it can be difficult to get a seat.
5 stars for happy hour, with a solid 4 for the rest of the time (the full menu is tasty in itself, albeit a bit rich). Even when I promise myself I am going to try another happy hour, I end up here - and always leave so happy, full, and ready to come back."
Barolo Ristorante,Melanie N.,"Today I enjoyed a delicious meal at Barolo. We went on a tip that their bar menu was half off all day on Sunday. The bar menu was full of diverse, large meals! You could enjoy a cheese plate, salad, burger, homemade pasta dishes or beef tenderloin. I enjoyed the rigatoni with beef and veal ragu! It was a hearty, delicious meal! I loved it! The only down side to the meal was the service. It was slow and rather inattentive. Even that, wouldn't keep me from going back and enjoying another great meal at Barolo! I'd suggest trying this wonderful Italian restaurant, especially on a Sunday!"
Barolo Ristorante,Alexis M.,This was the best pasta dish I have had in years. I got the penne with smoked salmon in a cream sauce with no asparagus. We also had the grilled octopus which was delicious as well. A little pricy for pasta (25$ for mine) but it was totally worth it!
Artusi,Laura C.,"Artusi is in my top 5 neighborhood spots, which is highly competitive on the Hill. It's taken me a long time to write this review, frankly because I want Artusi all to myself. The food is incredible and well priced, the service is informed and friendly, and the ambience is warm and cozy.
Food: My favorite always menu item is the meatball, it's on the HH menu and the dinner menu. Seriously, it's legit the best meatball of my life and I really try not to say that in my yelp reviews, but this one is seriously special. It's a little spicy, filling, and comes with a lovely piece of crusty bread. The pastas are made in-house and rotates seasonally. These guys service brunch too, and it's out of this world! The hash, the risotto, the bevvies! All legit.
Service: The staff here are friendly, warm, and experienced. They know their wine, make incredible cocktails, and make incredible recommendations. This is truly a neighborhood spot and this staff is what makes it really feel like home."
Artusi,Jenny Z.,"Had been here a few times moreso for drinks and apps, but this past Monday we came for dinner. The pasta and wine night is divine. It is 2 pastas and a bottle for $40. I get skeptical about house red wine because it's generally on the sweeter side but this cab was perfect. We had about a glass left and took it home and enjoyed it the next day.
The pasta... yum. We ordered tagliatelle and gnocchi. The tagliatelle was a chicken one which I had never had before but it was good. Almost a pot pie flavor. The gnocchi had mushrooms and may have been my favorite gnocchi dish ever. My husband hates mushrooms and was even picking out the mushrooms to eat specifically. So tasty.
We also had some olives and meatballs. Meatballs are $5 each on happy hour which are a little expensive since they're not huge - but nonetheless very tasty.
It was an ideal amount of food and because of pasta and wine night, not expensive at all for what you get. Definitely recommend! But do expect a wait unless you get there right at open for pasta and wine night. We got there at 5:30 pm expecting some bar seating but every seat was taken and we waited about 40 min. We just headed over to Elysian a couple blocks away for a drink - which I recommend as well!"
Artusi,Malia M.,"WHY ARE YOU READING THIS INSTEAD OF EATING THE MEATBALLS ALREADY
Order 3 plates of meatballs because they're ridiculous.
I also rec the tagliatelle if its available when you're in
This place is insane in such a good way. Prices are reasonable.
Authentic, fresh and a chill environment. Great HH.
Drinks are strong, I love the seating in here and the paper lanterns.
Don't make the same mistakes I did: don't bring anyone here, including yourself, if the best Italian food you've/they've had is from Olive Garden. For example, if you're looking to bring your parents to a nice italian spot because they're paying for it, prepare for them to make some bad comments about really great food."
Artusi,Mimi N.,"Woohoo! Been here a few times and last night made me realize why Artusi is definitely a spot I would recommend as a worthy visit if you're in the Caphill area.
For Sunday/Monday nights - Come here and definitely check out the awesome Pasta Night special. At this time, it's a stellar deal of 2 pasta dishes + a bottle of wine (red/white/rose) for only $40! The earlier you show up, the shorter the wait. Came here around 5:30pm and snagging a table was pretty quick. By 630, entire restaurant (table/bar) was packed and wait time can vary between 30-45min+.
Food: Tried the special pasta with beef cheeks and this was absolutelyyyyy yummmms. Felt like the pasta melted in my mouth. Also, did try the Tonnarelli but wasn't a big fan of the noodles and texture. In the past, have tried the fried bread (so good!!!) and meatballs and these two remain consistently good. Overall, food here is yum and worth the visit.
Drinks: If you're not hungry but you're thirsty instead, check out the cocktails here! I tried a few drinks out and all were so so yummy. Can't go wrong with anything~~~~
In gist, love this spot for food and drinks. It's a bit of a walk from the hustle & bustle of Caphill but definitely worth it. Plus, if you want additional desserts, Regent Bakery is just right across the street."
Artusi,Lynden L.,"We came as a party of 2 a bit after 12:30pm on Sunday for their Brunch Special ($35 for 2 entrees and a cocktail pitcher).
We did not have a very long wait (only as long as it took them to set up the table) as we came in as most people were leaving (finding a parking spot in caphill on a sunday took much longer!) and quickly sat down at a nice little table next to the window. The Brunch Special is what it is and we ordered the Risotto, Benedicto, and Apricot Collins.
Everything was beautifully presented and our server even helped us pour our first drinks from the ""pitcher"" (not really a pitcher, probably has only around 3 small glasses worth of liquid, including ice). The risotto was very interesting as it has a vinegary/sour taste, but overall we still liked it with the bacon crumbles and raw egg yolk on top. However, we did find that as it was served as a thin layer on a very shallow plate, the risotto did get cold quickly as you ate it. The benedicto was also great, as I loved that they used foccacia in place of english muffin, which soaked up all the lovely hollandaise sauce and runny egg yolk. It seemed lighter than your normal eggs benedict and left you craving for more as opposed to stuffed full of greasiness.
The apricot collins was refreshing -- not too sweet and just the right amount of alcohol. And what a pretty color as well!
Overall, we loved our experience but the portion sizes (for both entrees and drinks) are definitely on the smaller side. But the $35 deal is definitely a reasonable price in the CapHill area. This is probably great for a girls' brunch but me being a girl still found myself hungry afterwards and had to make a stop at Bakery Nouveau for a chocolate croissant to round out my meal."
Artusi,Marcela V.,"This is one of my favorite spots to bring out of towners. It is Spinasse's sister restaurant, a little less expensive but just as good! They make all their pasta in-house and have some amazing plates. The best thing about Artusi is their pasta special on Sundays & Mondays. You can order two pastas and a bottle of wine for $40! It is a perfect place for date night. I definitely recommend coming early though because it's a small space and does full up quickly. The plates can be pretty small so I recommend ordering an appetizer or dessert to supplement the small portion size, but I can't complain too much when you're getting such a good deal. I will definitely continue to go to Artusi!"
Artusi,Derek M.,"The sister-restaurant to Spinasse. Cozy seating area with small tables that won't seat more than 4 comfortably. Shares a restaurant menu with Spinasse which is easy to access through an open wall on the way to the restroom. Food is just as delicious as Spinasse but the menu feels a little more condensed. Definitely the over-flow bar when Spinasse gets busy, but still offers the same quality food and service for smaller groups trying to dine at Spinasse without a reservation. Food is top-notch but don't expect a large portion of food. This is the place to go if you don't have a reservation at Spinasse and you have a group of 5 or smaller."
Artusi,Victoria C.,"This is brunch only
Good service here.
The risotto is great and pretty flavorful. Portions are good sized - not too much and not too little.
Pancakes were pretty basic. I didnt think the pancakes tastes anything special. I wasnt too big fan of the eggs - I didnt taste the crab too much
They have 2 meals and pitcher deal - 35$. I'd say the pitcher is about 4 drinks. Spritzer wasnt too sweet.
No bloody Mary's here if anyone cares!"
Artusi,Mei P.,"I came to Artusi because a friend of mine suggested it's Sunday and Monday's dinner special where you get two (2) pastas and a bottle- yes a bottle- of wine for $40 total. What a steal!
I got the Maltagliati pasta that was made with beef short rib and bf got the Beef ravioli special. We also ordered a side of bread ($2) with olive oil as a starter. I really liked my pasta. The beef was extra tender! And the pasta was wonderful! I just wish there was more.
For the wine, we ordered the rose which was delicious. Very crisp and refreshing! I like my rose to be on the dry side and the one that was on selection was perfect.
The 2 pastas and a bottle of wine special sounds like a good deal but it ends up just breaking even in my opinion. The pasta and wine were delicious but there just wasn't that much food, especially if you were hungry before hand. A good place for people with smaller appetites that want to share a bottle of nice wine for dinner but probably not substantial."
Artusi,Ellen B.,"I've only been to Artusi for brunch, but I'd love to return for dinner too. I was pleasantly surprised with my experience at brunch. I wouldn't recommend Artusi for large groups- but my friends and I always do it anyways because we like to suffer and wait for tables. We had a table of 6 and we all opted for the Special $30 two food items + cocktail pitcher and split them amongst two people. I'm not sure if this is designed for one person to have two dishes and a cocktail pitcher or for two people because the dishes are just a tad too small portion wise for a good meal. However, the bonus of a cocktail pitcher for only $30 total makes up for it. Most brunch places in Capitol Hill will be $15 for your meal + $11-15 for ONE mimosa on top of that so this is one of the much better value places in my opinion. The risotto and the hash are my favorites so I'd highly recommend those two.
We all ordered different cocktail pitchers so we could try them all. However, the waitress was adamant that the cocktails needed to be served in the correct glasses and that we couldn't share because it wasn't possible to pour them into other glasses. So... we did it anyways behind her back. That was kind of a weird experience, but the cocktail pitcher experience was fun and we all enjoyed ourselves.
Overall I can't wait to return to Artusi for brunch again and also to try dinner!"
Artusi,Daniel L.,"Decided to try this place for happy hour on a weekday. Food is tasty but very pricy with tiny portions. Cost $5 for a single meatball, $12 for about 10 pieces of mini-ravioli. And the drinks are good but nothing special at high prices. Wouldn't recommend for happy hour as they didn't have good deals - it might be good for a date night though. We ended up going to another place after spending a lot of money here without getting full or drunk"
Artusi,JT T.,"Artusi is definitely worth a visit for its pasta nights: 2 pastas (there are usually 3 or 4 on the menu) and a bottle of house wine for $40. This is a fantastic deal for the neighborhood and for the regular prices (~$20 for a pasta alone) at this establishment. That said, pastas (and all the dishes I saw) are pretty small, so order an appetizer or two if you're a normal amount hungry. The food itself is really nicely prepared and presented; everything was cooked well and had a good balance of flavors. Restaurant/bar is fairly small--for groups, I don't think they could seat a table of more than maybe 6-8 people--so go early on busy evenings (Friday through Monday)"
Artusi,Travis L.,"Recently visited with a couple of friends. We had an assortment of the anti-pastas and we also ordered the three main pastas and the special, as well as the meatballs.
The burrata was pretty good, not a huge fan of the minced zucchini but throw it on some bread dipped in olive oil and cuts some of the sweetness. Really enjoyed the Fra'Mani salame della sera. I liked the pears sugary sweetness with the saltiness of the meats.
The Tonnarelli and the special pasta of the night were very on point but found the risotto to be salty and gnocchi a bit dense. However, aside from those two critiques the flavor profiles were forward and pleasant.
Finally, had the tiramisu (off menu) for desert, very light, would have preferred a stronger mascarpone and cocoa flavor.
The food came out at a decent pace but our server could be reminded she's in the service business.
Regardless, enjoyed the atmosphere and might return but would probably rather just go to Spinasse."
Artusi,Enquan X.,"Food was pretty nice!
Had Happy Hour sparkling and snack(pasta).
I ordered the steak as main. My friend said I'm the bitch haha.
The steak wasn't in the right temp , plate was cold, cold plate for mid-cocked steak. That's the pity ! Steak didn't have much seasonings over, I assume it would rely on the right temp and timing to bring the good flavor. A hot/warm plate can be a saver!
Dessert was pretty, would be good for two 2 share.
Personal thoughts"
Artusi,Shannon L.,"Came here again - for happy hour this time. Maintaining the 4 star review. My biggest gripe is the portions are really small. My friend and I split the pasta of the day for $12 on HH and it was amazing, but very small. We also shared the fried bread and I was slightly underwhelmed by it. The prosciutto seemed more like turkey and I just found it more random than crafty and good. The house red we had from the happy hour was really good, too. Service pretty decent too. Just need to increase those portions!
Went for brunch today (a sunday) and overall a pleasant experience. First positive was that there wasn't a wait like there were for many other places in the area. On Sundays they have a special of $30 for 2 entrees and a pitcher (but really...a carafe) which was a decent deal. I would, however, warn that the entrees are not very big. I was content after eating but know several people who wouldn't have had enough with the smaller portions. Service was great though. Worg"
Artusi,Summer W.,"The perfect date night! On Sunday and Monday night, Artusi gives you the choice of two entrees and a bottle of wine for $40. Between their ambiance and the delicious food, it's a recipe for a great night.
Whenever I see the gnocchi on the menu, I say YES! It's the perfect pillow of delicious dumpling goodness. Try it and you won't regret it.
Pros: great deal (if you come at the right time), delicious food, fantastic service
Cons: limited seating, street parking"
Artusi,Rosa K.,"It was a Friday night and we were actually meaning to go to Cascina Spinasse next door, they said the wait was 1.5 hours! I look over and Artusi is literally next door! It was about 8:30pm and we were starving and I have been wanting to try out Artusi so we decided to go there for a drink and light bites.
I got a glass of red wine and my boyfriend got an old fashion.
We said light bites, but I think we were hungrier than we though. We ordered the potato gnocchi and the braised pork belly.
I have had gnocchi before but I usually pick pasta over the gnocchi so I wasn't expecting to be wowed but boy, was I wrong. The gnocchi was cooked perfect. It had the perfect bite to it- soft and chewy. The lamb ragu was delicious and went perfectly with the gnocchi.
I was excited to try the braised pork belly. I have never had pork belly that was this tender before. The pork belly just fell apart. It was so tender, soft and just melted in my mouth. The 6 minute egg- the yoke beautifully would ooze out onto the pork belly. The culmination of the rich egg and the pork belly was magical. I would go back just for this dish."
Artusi,Alex M.,"I had the Tonnarelli Corti and it was delicious. The only part I didn't like was the pork cheeks- just not a fan. I also had the ""As I Lay Drinking"" cocktail and definitely get if you're into gin!
But, our server was sooo rude at the end. We asked if we could split checks and she barely gave us the time of day to tell us that they don't do it for groups of 6 or more. I totally understand that it's a rule, but our waitress handled the situation poorly."
Artusi,Beau S.,Artusi has brunch now!! It might be limited time but you get a pitcher of mixed drinks and 2 menu items for $30.. The pancetta risotto was cheesy delicious with a yolk in the middle. I also got the dutch baby which was good but a little small. Dinner is also really good with a good happy hour for food and drinks.
Artusi,Kent L.,"I got the risotto for 12 dollars. Definitely one of the best risottos I have had. Very flavorful, has some slight acidity that really went well with the dish. Egg yolk in the middle (though unsure if it added more flavor to the dish). Portions were a bit smaller than I would have hoped, but I could see myself returning for more."
Bucatini,Tom B.,"This is one place where you really can learn a lot just by looking at the photos. You can see hearty Italian food, fairly traditional, presented beautifully in a nice dining room. That's a good summary of what's on offer here.
This is one of many strip malls in block after block of strip malls on the way down to the Edmonds ferry. There's just enough parking (barely).
Inside, everything's just nice enough--you're not paying for a bunch of fountains and premium real estate, but the whole bar and both dining rooms are pretty. Dimly lit, nice earthy paint colors on the walls, fun vintage ads, nice furniture and table settings. There's not much of a lobby, and the place gets busy. They don't take reservations, either, so you might be waiting outside if you come during the rush.
The menu is fairly short. Lots of classics, almost always with local ingredients and some creative touch from the chefs and cooks in back. There's a wine list, and a few beers on tap and in bottles. Full bar, too.
For food, one server pointed out that their special list really is the creative heart of the kitchen. What they feel like cooking and the ingredients they're most excited about are what shows up there. The regular menu has tons of stuff you want, too, and it's where the starters are. They're always welcome with any meal.
The food here runs to a hearty, home-cooked vibe. Some of the ingredients are a little fancier than your average home dinner, but they slow-cook the sauces and give you big portions; you feel like your grandma is worried you're not eating enough, so she gave you this. Not only is it a big serving, but it's something she figures you'll eat every bite of even if you're getting full.
Even the lunch portions are huge, by the way. The dinner portions blow those away. You could easily order fewer entrees than you have people and share plates, especially if you get starters.
We had the caesar salad, which has real caesar dressing made from scratch in house. With eggs. Real caesar! I love it. You can get anchovies, and you can wear your server out waiting for just the right-size mountain of fresh ground black pepper. This is a proper way to start a meal. They're also constantly bringing you out some really nice bread.
We got a bottle of a local cab for $35, from Virtue. It was an amazing bargain at that price, and suited the meal perfectly. Their headquarters are close to Edmonds, too, which is cool.
For entrees, we had the Pescatore Romano, which was a mountain of shellfish and a little finfish on squid ink pasta. The Tre Ragu was a heap of elk, lamb, and something else on big noodles. Both came simmered in garlicky, herby tomato sauce (I assume slightly different recipes). We couldn't finish all the fish, but the meat dish was all gone, right down to the last of the sauce sopped up with still more bread.
We missed the desserts and after-dinner drinks, but this was a huge hearty meal served quickly and presented beautifully for less than most places charge for such ($135 for 4 total plates + wine). This would be an easy place to get addicted to. We'll definitely get back."
Bucatini,Vy P.,"This place was a nice surprise! My friend and I were craving some Italian food and we decided to check this place out. I had not heard much about it and, *surprise*, I didn't even check Yelp before going... Everything was quite with a small hiccup in service.
LOCATION & PARKING //
It's in this very small and dark side plaza in Edmonds (across from PCC). It's not very well lit from the outside so keep an eye out if you're using Google Maps or something. I had to make a small u-turn once I realized I passed it. The location itself is small but cozy. There is parking in a private lot so I wouldn't worry about that.
FOOD //
I got the FARFADELLE ALFREDO with CHICKEN. I love anything with alfredo so I figured this would be a good choice... and it was. First of all, the other reviewers are correct. The portions here are huge. I only ate about 1/3 of my plate and took the rest for home. The pasta was smooth and buttery. The sauce was not too overwhelming and it was the right texture. Some places make these dishes too ""saucy"" but I felt like there wasn't a pool of sauce on the bottom. In fact, the sauce just coated the pasta, as it should. They also give a decent amount of chicken too! Best part? The pasta tasted just as delicious as leftovers.
I also want to touch on the complimentary bread... because it was super soft and fluffy. Seriously, go for it.
AMBIANCE //
Like I mentioned before, it's small and cozy. I didn't expect that from here. It's strange to say, but it reminds me of a cozy inn in a small town. It's a great spot for families, dates, friends, etc. The entire vibe is very intimate.
SERVICE //
I feel quite conflicted about this because the service from the servers was absolutely fantastic. I never felt rushed to order or pay the check and they consistently checked up on us. My concern here is how we (and other customers) were addressed and seated. When we arrived, there was a man who seemed to be in charge of seating everyone. We weren't acknowledged for 5 minutes and when he walked us to our table, it felt like he was annoyed at us/servers in general. It was quite strange.
OVERALL // 4.5 stars
I had a great experience here and will consider coming back if I'm craving some Italian food. Not sure what really happened with the small service problem though..."
Bucatini,Kellye M.,"We had the caprese salad, bolongnese alforno, tortellini con pesto. Everything was excellent. Liked the bolongnese the most. Truly spectacular. We also had the cannoli cake. That had to be the best cake I've ever had. It was moist. The frosting had a nice orange flavor and it was just delicious, and I don't like cannoli.
Nice family atmosphere. Very homey. Staff was very friendly. Keely was an excellent waitress. Will definitely come again!"
Bucatini,Annie Y.,"I just love this place. The owner of the restaurant is always around and you can sense the dedication in the food. Everything we've ordered so far was delicious and plentiful. Service has always been friendly and unobtrusive. We love to get one of the specials when we visit and it's ones of those few places where you can't go wrong with anything you try. They have a relatively small kitchen but they dish out big flavors. Super impressive, a standout in the neighborhood."
Bucatini,Samuel W.,"Do not order Bolognese Al Forno! I had a terrible experience yesterday at lunch with this extremely salty food. Waitress was kind enough to bring me more plain pasta and glass of water, but could not help much with the ready made sauce."
Bucatini,Shaylor S.,"Most authentic Italian place I've been to. Was pretty skeptical with this place because it is a bit pricer and I wasn't sure it would be worth it. Mamma Mia I was very wrong. Guys!! Come here.
I got ""the grinder"" not really knowing what it was going to be like. They came out with a literal canoe-shaped thing of bread that was perfectly cooked, crispy, and fresh. It was filled with multiple cheeses, very unique cut of salami (my absolute favorite), tiny onion bulbs that were still intact but cooked and caramelized to perfection, and a bunch of other flavorful things that made this one of the best Italian dishes I've had! I was really hungry and I couldn't even finish it! Had to take the last little bit home because it was so good. Portion sizes parallel the price you're paying so don't let the price deter you too much.
The other reason this place is 5 stars is because the service here is unmatched. They focus on the little things like making sure your drink is always filled up, replacing the appetizer bread (that is free) before you can think to ask for more, giving everyone a mint at the end, giving you a full rundown of their specials, having thick towel-like napkins, going out of their way to thank you for coming in, and so much more! For me, those little things go a long way.
Some big things they do is hook you up when you misunderstand what you ordered. One of my friends thought they ordered something that had a similar name to something else and when they brought it out she realized it was not was she ordered. The waitress took it back and within five minutes she brought out the correct one. It wasn't anyone's fault but they took on themselves to make the customer a priority. We were all very pleased.
The only thing I didn't like was the water because it tasted a little like plastic. It was only the first couple refills that had that taste. But besides that, I got nothing but positive stuff to say!
Great Italian atmosphere that is authentic, hospitable, inviting, packed with freshness and flavor! They just do it right here."
Bucatini,Mona M.,"I'm no Italian but I felt right at home. I felt like we were treated like a family even though it was our first time here. They made us feel like our business is important to them and that out presence mattered from the moment we entered the restaurant until we walked out that door.
When we arrived at the restaurant for an early dinner, there were several people waiting for a table. The owner Anthony happened to be entering the restaurant at the same time like we did. He smiled widely, greeted us and held the door open for us. The two of us were able to get a seat immediately. Bread is served as a starter as you browse through their menu (olive oil and balsamic vinegar at the table). Our waitress was super nice and all smiles. She made recommendation, checked on us a lot but mostly gave us our privacy.
We got the half salad upon her recommendation, portion is actually huge. I could overhear our waitress saying the same thing to other patrons that the Caesar's salad is the best that she has ever had. But I agree that it was indeed very good. For meal I got Di Mare Puttanesca which was their squid ink pasta served the entire habitat of the ocean in it. I mean seriously my plate came with a generous helping of lobster, tuna, rock fish, mussels, clams, calamari, octopus, and prawns swimming in a spicy marinara with capers, anchovies, and Kalamata olives. Dear God the portion is HUGE! Meanwhile he had the Carbonara Antonio with smoked pork belly bacon which was delicious though a little on the salty side.
We weren't able to finish our meal because we got sooo full. Nonetheless we couldn't pass on dessert. We opted for Spumoni as it would be easier to swallow than cake. Well, I love the spumoni. We got three scoops and it was not too sweet.
Excellent service with great food. I definitely enjoy the vibe here. It seems like everyone knows everyone, truly feels like being among friends and family in here. Parking can be tough, but they mention there's another nearby parking that you can park at (I think it was at the bank or something.. I can't seem to remember the exact details now - please call the restaurant for details.)"
Bucatini,Nathan S.,"This is a no-nonsense, legit Italian eating place. I lived in Italy for 2 years and returned back to the States 9 years ago. I'm always a little... or a lot... let down when I try Italian restaurants because it's just never the same as the real thing. This is the first Italian place since Italy that I have loved! No complaints. I'll even let the chicken Alfredo dish slide since I understand they have to appease our misguided American demand.
This trip made my 4th of July weekend. Great food, great service, fair price for the quality and quantity you get. I wish I didn't live 3 hours away. The restaurant doesn't look like much from the outside, but the I side is nice, and their attention is on the food...none of the flashy stuff.
Bravissimo! Si mangia!"
Bucatini,Melanie J.,"I am so full!
We love this place, and we should have left a review a long time ago. My family is never disappointed, lunch or dinner... so delicious!
One of those amazing, unassuming places. Fresh, fresh, fresh, and passion in the form of food. Can't go wrong, unless you go to another Italian place in Edmonds, then you have sold yourself short. Thank goodness, they are growing to handle the demand. Highly recommend and bonus, the staff has always been great!"
Bucatini,Brian M.,"One of the better Italian places I've been to. Their ""featured items"" we tried were excellent. A small cozy place with a bar, I recommend business casual attire. Parking stalls are on the slimmer side."
Bucatini,Sharmi R.,"We ordered chicken Parmiginana sandwich , which was so huge and one person can't finish it as it's really cheesy. It was good and we need to finish it before it turns cold so please plan to share it . We also got the Di mare puttanesca which was huge portion of seafood with ink pasta. There were more mussels and only few shrimp and just 1 piece of small lobster tail which was disappointing. The pasta was chewy probably could have been cooked a bit more. These 2 dishes were like 4 star but I am giving 3 star because of the kid dish. The kid's pasta was so chunky and undercooked with a TBs of shredded parmigiana and butter. My kid is a good eater and won't complain much, trust me it was so bland and bad. There was like 3 kid's option and I am not sure what others tasted like. I am rating this 3* just because of kids menu. We were the only ones in the restaurant but still no cutlery even after 7-8 mins after lunch was served, they apologized for the same still I feel it should have been done right considering the restaurant was empty. We enjoyed food though just not my kiddo."
Bucatini,Rochelle H.,This was a pleasant surprise. Was meeting a friend for dinner and chose this from Yelp. I was so good. Tony is the nicest and the staff is so kind. The flavors make your mouth water. It was full with patrons but the wait was not long. I will drive up from Bonney Lake for another meal. Excellent!! Definite do again.
Bucatini,Matt C.,"Long live this meal.
Bucatini is a hidden gem tucked away in an Edmonds strip mall. The low lit, romantic wine bar is home to 5-star eats from beginning to end. It truly was a perfect dining experience and I need to write this review while it's still fresh in my mind!
Oddly enough I didn't order a pasta dish. I know what you're thinking, ""Matt, are you okay? Is something bothering you? Why aren't you consuming pasta 24/7?""
I'll tell you why. Typically at a fancy Italian restaurant, I would 100% order a composed Italian pasta dish. However, Bucatini has...get this...a Heroes & Grinders menu! Any good Italian knows the immortalized significance of this. I am so, so happy with my decision to order ""The Grinder.""
The Grinder - Capicola, Mortadella and Calabrese Salami w/ Grilled Caramelized Onions & Provolone on Toasted Ciabatta. Say hello to heaven, folks. This sandwich had it all; salty, savory, sweet, cheesy and crispy components that worked phenomenally. Plus, the sandwich was the size of my head. Have you seen my head? Yeah, it's that big!
I'm also not one to praise a salad, but the Caesar Salad I ordered prior to my sandwich was a 6-star salad. Homemade dressing, whole leaf lettuce and deliciously addictive croutons, with a squeeze of fresh lemon elevated this salad into a beautiful starter.
Service was stellar. Our waitress knew the specials like the back of her hand, filled every glass, and was continuously one step ahead. The owner even came out to talk to us and the other tables, which is always a memorable touch. Cannot recommend Bucatini enough!
Do you ship grinders to Jacksonville? I'll pay for overnight shipping."
Bucatini,Jodi B.,"Have visited Bucatini's a few times now since recently moving into the area and the food never disappoints. I've never ventured outside of pasta with regards to what to eat, but also why would I? It's amazing! Bucatini Alla Napolitana is a personal favorite, delicious, the Polpi Nona is also great, but on the specials so unsure how often it's available. They also just expanded and doubled in size, which is cool to see for a local business.. You should definitely give this place a try if you're in the area!"
Bucatini,SJ S.,"Can't rave enough about this place. Tonight I chose to call for take out on a rainy blustery night. Bucatini with House made Meatballs, Bolognese and a side of Sausage. Gotta have the sausage. 15-20 minutes later it was ready. Just LOVE the food here. It is always good. Dine in or take out. Either both. Place is awesome. The only thing I forgot was to add a bottle of wine. (An option even to go). The selection is great and extremely reasonable. Thanks guys. My dinner was delish!
Back today to grab grinders for workers. Everyone loved them and wanted to know where they came from. Two of them enjoyed The Steak Grinder and said it was the best Steak Sandwich they had ever had in their lives. Thanks Bucatini for a great meal and making me look good! Awesome as always."
Bucatini,Shannon M.,"First time here. We thoroughly enjoyed the experience. It's a small place. No reservations, we came around 5pm and got in without a wait. Garlic aroma hit us as we walked in. We ordered an antipasto plate, clams and pasta, meat bolognese and a kids marinara. Marinara pasta had a bright flavor and was completely consumed. The bolognese was delish! We helped my daughter clean the bowl. House wines by the glass went well with the meal.
Would definitely return!"
Bucatini,Jennifer K.,"Wow! What a great, local, neighborhood restaurant. Upon arrival on a Saturday night we were absolutely shocked by the amount of people that were waiting. It didn't seem that busy until we realized ... ""OH it's really busy."" We waited for about 30 minutes till being seated (which I think was relevantly short compared to others) and we ordered immediately since we had plenty of time to browse over the menu.
We decided to go with the Steak grinder, Bucatini alla Napolitana and the Bucatini with Homemade meatballs. Warning: that is A LOT of food for just two people and we had plenty of leftovers for the next day. During dinner the severs and the atmosphere reminded us a lot of home and everything was right up our alley. If you're looking for good, no frills Italian that you can bring the whole family (especially with really good food) this is the place to go!"
Bucatini,Mohamed N.,"""Delightful Italian in slightly out-of-the-way strip mall""
We came here with a group of 6 on a Friday night at 6pm and were fortunately able to be seated in this rather small place, though the restaurant filled up very quickly thereafter. The restaurant is at the end of a strip mall with very limited parking, but there are signs noting that you can park at a nearby bank. One of my party has a severe legume/ soy allergy, but as with traditional Italian food (but unlike some chain places), this restaurant only uses olive oil and occasionally canola oil.
The setting is a bit dimly lit and cozy but not TOO crowded. The servers were quite attentive-- our glasses never fully emptied, and both they and someone I presume was the manager checked on us repeatedly. I was still full from lunch so I just ordered a caprese salad. My dining partners got the caprese classic sandwich, a different salad, or the Di Mare Puttanesca. We had delicious bread while we waited (refilled as many times as we wanted), and there was olive oil and balsamic vinegar on the table.
The food was DELICIOUS.
The caprese salad was a bit small, but exceptionally well done. It was exactly what I wanted. Probably not meant to be a meal by itself, but a good appetizer.
The caprese classic sandwiches were the salad in a GIANT half-ciabatta, and decorated with a cute Italian flag. Everyone loved them, and the bread soaked some of the balsamic and oil making it also delicious. Pro-tip: do NOT order this sandwich toasted-- it comes out like a giant crouton. It's nicely crispy without toasting. This will fill up a hungry eater for sure.
Our friends enjoyed their puttanseca and salad immensely too.
Overall, an excellent local, out-of-the-way option for high-quality Italian food. The price is fair for the high quality-- definitely a significant step up in quality, food presentation, and ambiance from Olive Garden and such (though I like those too)."
Bucatini,C R.,"Visiting friends in the area and we chose Bucatini for our New Years meal and we couldn't be happier! Fantastic food, very kind and attentive service, and a chef from New York with a passion for making dishes from scratch. Highly recommended!!!"
Bucatini,Tracy W.,Wonderful Italian food. Haven't had Italian this great since I moved here from New York. Wonderful wine selection. Slower service happens on a busy weekend.
Carrello,Katrina M.,"Dinner with my husband tonight and we came here for the first time. Carrello made for a wonderful evening with a great setting and a great feel!
What is unique about their restaurant is the small plates they serve via rolling carts. We had heard about these and being a fan of trying many dishes, we came not knowing if you could make a dinner of these small offerings or not.
They offered about 10 small dishes throughout the time we were here and we had about 7 of them. They were all wonderful but they were small (some only $3-4 each but ranged to $11) and not enough to make a dinner. So we ordered a salad, a pasta and a fish (whole branzino) from the main menu as well. This was the perfect amount of food as the main menu dishes were small also. Total bill before tip was about $135.
Food was fantastic, loved it all. Pasta had a wonderful texture, but it was a small dish size as well. We had so many things that it is difficult to name them all. Fun place to go, especially if you like to try many things instead of one single entree."
Carrello,Gav J.,"I have to align with Kevin Z who nailed it in his review below. Unnecessarily pretentious waitstaff ruined what could've been a really great experience. the space is lovely and in a beautiful part of Capitol Hill.
The initial service is fantastic and the bread is to die for, however the pasta was overcooked, salad overdressed and the wait staff less than friendly.
Dessert yielded the worst semi Freddo ever. The cart concept is fantastic but fails to deliver on the food and ultimately provided an overall mediocre experience at a high cost.
I will not be returning here again."
Carrello,Nate H.,"I'll be honest with you I wasn't that impressed just looking at the pictures of this place. It looked like a place where I would get a really small pasta dish and destroy my credit score doing so. Boy was I wrong... this place is fantastic.
Luckily for Carrello, my girlfriend convinced me to go to this place with her for our anniversary because she really liked the decorations (hanging plants bring the ladies in apparently). We were very impressed by the ambiance and the friendly service. You definitely get the chic hipster vibe when you're in here, so make sure you wear your finest beanie.
This place combines incredible pasta with a mini surprise dish at every turn. They give you a wooden block which signifies to the wait staff if you're in the mood for some Italian delicacies. As you're waiting for your dishes, they bring around all sorts of goodies from calamari, to fancy meatballs, or a massive tray of desserts.
The pasta itself made me want to kiss an Italian grandmother. We took the risk of getting a dish with tripe in it for the first time ever, and it paid off. I can't even remember what the name of the pasta was, but the blend of tripe and veal was so rich and creamy that I forgot I was eating a baby animals and stomach lining."
Carrello,Elizabeth L.,"Tasty pasta, limited menu selection, $$$-$$$$. With its Altura lineage, the pasta at Carrello is delicious - absolutely recommend the agnolotti, pappardelle with oxtail, tripe, anchovy crumb, and gnocchi, all which were divine. We also enjoyed the spicy pan roasted brassicas (broccolini, cauliflower), despite the steep price at $17 for a veggie side.
Aside from the limited menu, Carrello features an Italian take on dimsum with small plates being offered on carts. The roasted beets were tasty but otherwise average, the lamb meatball similarly so. While we enjoyed the prosciutto, the portion was rather miniscule. Would pass on the cured veal. According to our server, roughly 14 snacks and small plates are offered on carts each night.
In full disclosure, we avoided the From the Table meat entrees, which were steeply priced - $59 for roasted whole fish, $125 for dry aged ribeye (would expect 4-star steakhouse at that price), $47 for whole roasted chicken, $59 for roasted lamb neck (wow!).
Portions are small, as reviews note, so prepare to spend $60-$70 pp. Highly recommend cocktails and pasta if you're curious about the Carrello experience!"
Carrello,Mia Z.,"Interesting that it's Italian/American in dim sum style, they push out carts around the place every 10 min, small plates so you get to taste a lot of appetizers. We had beef tartar(amazing), rabbit and pork meat balls(absolutely fantastic), beet salad(good).
Each cart has a number on there which represents the price of the item. Then they mark on the small sheet of paper on your table of what you get (like how dim sum works).
I highly recommend coming for the cart. The entree pastas are mediocre to me. We will be back for only cart."
Carrello,Sheryl K.,"Recently tried this place and I can't wait to go back and try more things!
The concept of the restaurant is really similar to dim sum where people come around with carts of food and mark off what you select on a note card. However, this experience was probably a lot better than going to a dim sum restaurant because they don't pressure you and push you to buy food! I guess you can say it's Italian cuisine with the dim sum cart concept.
I can't remember what we picked up from the carts and what we ordered through our server, but everything was very delicious. My only negative comment is that some dishes were pretty spicy but I'm super weak sauce with spicy food. So if you're a normal person that can handle mildly spicy to pretty hot foods, you'd love it. My entree had a slight kick, which was ok-ish for me. I would've preferred no kick/no spice at all, but that's just me. But ate all of it because it was that tasty!
So if you're looking for an Italian restaurant that has a fun ordering experience, I highly recommend coming to try this place out. I'm definitely ready to come back and try more!"
Carrello,Jacqueline D.,"We got a reservation here on Tuesday night for a girls night. Surprising that we were able to make the reservation a few days prior, but I imagine it'll be harder as Carrello gets more and more well known.
Such a cool concept - you can order a bunch of food from a menu - large meat plates, pasta and apps.., and while waiting or eating, there are carts w/ smaller tapas size portions being pushed around that you can also order off of (imagine dim sum but make it italian). These range from $3-$12 and is super fun to supplement your main meal!
We also had some great wine - they do have a sommelier if you need additional help/recs to pair the right wine with your meal!
One of our group members was vegetarian, and although they don't have a ton of veg specific items, most menu items can be made vegetarian with fantastic substitutes, where it didn't feel like a substitution/customized dish!
Everything we tried was delicious - from the apps, to small plates to pasta... great flavors and honestly afterwards made me excited for my next visit!!!"
Carrello,Sara C.,"I hate to review this because I know it's going to get harder and harder to snag reservations here, but they deserve it.
We heard from friends that the pasta is the way to go here, so we ordered three pastas - their gnocchi, agnolotti and chittara - and then ordered a few things from the different small plate carts.
The verdict - not only was the pasta SO good but the carts made it a really fun experience as well. Not to mention these small plates were VERY decently priced. For example, we got two plates of prosciutto and coppa for $3 EACH.
We really, really loved this place and would definitely want to come back again. I think the prices were just fine for the quality and experience."
Carrello,Sara A.,"I came across Carello when walking past it looking for a place to eat in the area. They have an interesting concept that I really appreciated. You order your entrees (larger and for the table to share--can take 40-60 mins) plus smaller dishes. They have carts going around throughout the evening with smaller bites you can share. They place a card on your table with number on it and and this number corresponds to the numbers on the cards with the small bites as well as the price of that particular item. Items on the carts vary daily.
We weren't too hungry so we got the beef and veal spaghetti, the brassicas (cauliflower mix), and bread and picked up fried artichoke hearts from one of the carts. I loves the spaghetti. The noodles were cooked perfectly and the sauce was on point. Not overly spicy, but very flavorful. The brassicas were on the spicy wide, but more like too many spices were used as opposed to hotness. It was a little overwhelming. We also munched on some bread which is served with olive oil and butter as an appetizer. The artichoke hearts were also delicious.
Overall, I had a great experience here and loved the food. The plates they have for the table did seem a bit overpriced for what they were though. Pastas and smaller sides were more reasonable."
Carrello,Latifa S.,"Opening night meal!
I've already been a big fan of Altura for a while, naturally I'd have to check out their new venture too. This place came up rather fast for a new spot. The old place closed down, chef Nathan took over! And viola! It's a whole new spot!
The menu was simple enough. Carts of items with prices on it: like dim sum but Italian style. Rabbit meatball, grilled octopus, hamachi crudo, grilled peppers, desserts etc. You pick what you want. And contorni/ salads/bread, pasta and meat/seafood. Meat and seafood dish take about 45-60 minutes to come out so order accordingly.
We had the octopus with lentil, chicory salad, grano with crab and rock shrimp, tagliatelle with anchovy oil and tonno (tuna heart). And the rosemary lemonade and red wine!
The octopus was amazing and delicious. Tiny bite sizes, spicy pepper. Just great. Pasta portions are much smaller than small portions. The tagliatelle was delicious: even had some kale in it? The grano sauce was good but pasta itself was undercooked. We like al dente in our Italian family but this was much undercooked. Would've been great to try a better cooked version.
The chicory was a ok as well. Overall, I was just excited to be here and trying the new concept from my old favorite spot. Cart concept was good but once you missed a cart, it took forever to come back. Some don't even come back. We missed the octopus first time around and got it almost an hour later. Since it's a cart item, you can't order it. Same with mussels. And dessert!
Our server was super friendly. Took about 35-40 minutes to get our bill and pay though. They got busy at the end, it got slow. Same with the carts: once you miss one, it takes forever to get it back since they remake it. . I'm a small eater and left hungry. Overall, 3.5 stars for opening night. But since I can't do .5, I'm rounding it up."
Carrello,Kelley J.,"Very solid spot, was pleasantly impressed. Despite many comments, can be very reasonably priced based discretionary orders- don't go loco w/ the carts."
Carrello,Mimi T.,"After dining at Altura recently, I was more than happy to find out about Carrello. We decided to come here for an anniversary celebration and the experience didn't disappoint! I've been to one other restaurant (that's not dim sum) that also specializes in traveling carts of food, but the first Italian one.
As for the food, you start with ordering the non-cart items (but if you're like us, we decided to pick a few small items from the carts as it came by first).
+PUMPKIN: We decided to order a contorni (vegetable side dish) and we were so happy to go with this one. The incredibly soft and almost creamy pumpkin (kind of reminded me of sweet potatoes) came topped with hazelnut butter and crispy guanciale! It was the perfect sweet and salty dish! Just to note, my boyfriend doesn't like pumpkin but this might've been one of our favorite dishes here!
-PARSNIP GNOCCHI: I think I just wasn't expecting this one. It's not quite a fluffy gnocchi (maybe because it's made of parsnip?) and came with bits of boar.
-GRANO ARSO RAVIOLI: This was the crab ravioli (came with 3). For this one, I also wasn't used to the pasta dough - it didn't really have the chewiness I normally like in pasta. It was almost stiff. But the broth it came with was deliciously light!
Of these menu items, I think I'd be hesitant to order more of the pasta - they weren't necessarily bad, just not my favorite pasta texture.
As for the cart items, I have to say that I'm the type of person that loves tapas and small dishes, so we definitely focused more on these. The cart items range from $3 upward and each cart has 2-3 items. For dessert, you tell them that you're done with the meal and someone will come out with a cart of all the dessert options!
+DUCK MOUSSE: This was definitely my favorite but I'm a sucker for liver mousses. Oh, and also the crackers were fried in duck fat - no biggie! The dish also came with cranberries on top (loved the tartness to cut the fat).
+BEEF CRUDO: Just so good. The cracker actually reminded us of the exact same crackers from Altura!
+FRIED DOUGH: Okay, can you really go wrong with fried dough? It was only $3, greatly seasoned and went amazingly with the salami.
+SALAMI: Delicious! A pretty good portion that you can also see them slicing in the middle of the restaurant!
+CELERY SALAD WITH ANCHOVY: This looks and sounds so simple but it was delicious! Don't skip out on it!
+LIMONCELLO SEMIFREDDO: Didn't really taste like limoncello to me but it was scrumptious nonetheless! The berries on the bottom were great too!
All in all, I think you get the Altura flavors without the high price tag (though I wouldn't say this is a cheap meal - though worth it!). The service is great and the staff are incredibly friendly! All in all, would definitely return!"
Carrello,Grace C.,"This is the pasta place that tried too hard and failed. Tl;dr- get the bread. The pasta is just normal pasta dishes with fancy additions that miss the mark completely.
To start we ordered the bread, potatoes and carrots to share. Two items off the dim sum carts. We each ordered our own pasta- I ordered the tagliatelle for myself.
The homemade bread for $8 is no joke. This is the best bread ever. It's soft and squishy in the middle and the crust has this crunch that is so delicious- it might be the only time I enjoyed the crust more than the inside. The bread alone is 5/5 stars and I am coming back for the bread.
The potatoes were nice- better than the carrots. The potatoes seemed to be double fried and has their own mayo and a sea of sage but so good. The carrots were ok- there's a little bit of bacon in the ocean that is peanuts and it has a tinge of sweetness that was kind of weird.
Off the dim sum cart we got a fried dough and some of the charcuterie- each $4 and not worth it. The fried dough was weird and bland. And to have the charcuterie wrapped around it (as suggested) did not enhance anything for me except the lament that I was down $8.
And the tagliatelle. What's disappointment. It looks nice in the pics- trust me- but it's topped with a giant mount of tuna in hopes to differentiate it from the normal spaghetti aglio e olio. The waiter recommended I mix in the tuna to make it less fishy but then I basically was eating an overly oily aglio e olio. Binging with babish would be disappointed with the amount of olive oil left over.
In short. Not coming back except for the wine and bread. The third star is for the bread."
Carrello,Kevin Z.,"Dining at a higher price point (which typically means small portions) can be a fantastic experience when done right. Carrello simply had too many misses for me to be a worthwhile experience for how much it cost.
We started with some bread and fried potatoes. This was the best course of the meal. The bread had a lovely char and was accompanied by some warm butter. Biting into the buttered bread was like crispy heaven. The potatoes were also crispy and well cooked, though the cooks went a little too crazy on the fried sage.
We then got a bunch of pasta to share, many of which had crispy fish flakes on top. While I understand that adding fish flakes or fish sauce can add a lot of umami to a dish, there was simply too much on our pasta which made it taste really fishy and unappetizing. I personally ordered the tagliatelle with tripe. Pasta was cooked well but I felt that the texture of the tripe really ruined the dish. The weird dim sum carts kept coming around the whole time. We ordered some small dishes but weren't really that impressed.
Overall I think I won't be returning for a second meal. The food was only OK and the atmosphere felt unnecessarily pretentious."
Carrello,Phil G.,"Carrello, I am constantly forgetting the name, was too much fun. The food was good too! We sat at the liquor bar to eat and immediately struck up conversations with the patrons and the engaging bartender named Firenze. My wife, the true foodie, ordered the food while I gabbed and posed. The pastas were fantastic as was everything else I ate. We ordered too much, as is our wont, and everything tasted wonderful. Everyone at Carrello was smiling, and this is a happy place to be.
The mother restaurant to Carrello is just across the street named Altura. It is a gastronomic destination with an expensive degustation menu. Carrello is the perfect counterpart, with its casual, boisterous vibe. Prices were reasonable but the experience made money irrelevant. A great time is priceless."
Carrello,Tracie D.,"Sits On the end of busy broadway street. My first time here and id have to say I'm very impressed. Staff is very nice especially the bartender!
Im fairly picky on my rating for YELP and overall food experience. But this place has been exceptional!
We had the spaghetti , ravioli, duck pasta , another dish was baked vegetables (sorry forgot the name which was amazing btw) and the fish entree. ALL WELL CRAFTED.
What caught me by surprise was the ""cart"" serving small tasters of their foods which doesn't happen much in seattle restaurants which is a nice surprise
The food options aren't huge but does make up in taste. Would have to say price is on the high end for portion size. If you were to come alone and wanted a ""meat"" dish it would be impossible to finish.
Id like to see smaller options for less. Which would be nice for bar areas seating when you're there for a quick bite. Cause pasta size is on point for single servings."
Carrello,Liz J.,"Service was definitely off. We got there 15 mins early and they made us wait until exactly 7:30 before we were seated, and they had a number of empty tables. They had a number of carts going around with apps/small plates, but half of the carts just went by our table and they didn't even tell us about what was on it. And we were looking at the servers directly since we were hungry.
When we finally did get our first item, no one had stopped by our table to even take a drink order. Which was a shame because I would have liked a glass of wine with the cured meats we got.
Food was delicious, we ordered 2 vegetable dishes and 3 pastas and enjoyed them all immensely. Unfortunately they were all brought them to us all at the same time. All 5 plates for a small table of 2. So we barely had enough room to fit it all in. And then we had to eat really quickly before the food got cold. We each got a glass of red which went wonderfully with each dish we got. Also the fork they give you has kind of wierd dimensions? Made it really difficult to use at times to cut items, as knives were not given.
Hoping these things improve, the food was delicious. When we did interact with the wait staff they we're very friendly."
Carrello,Vijay B.,"Nathan Lockwood is, without a doubt, Seattle's best chef and his first restaurant - Altura - is Seattle's best restaurant. Here's my review for Altura:
yelp.com/biz/altura-seat…
If you don't know the history, Altura used to be mostly a la carte. Eventually Lockwood switched to a prixe fixe menu to showcase his culinary talents (which, if Michelin ever came to Seattle, would be amply rewarded) but that had a downside. Many of the favorite a la carte menu items were jettisoned much to the chagrin of his regular patrons. When this was brought up with Lockwood, he mentioned that he had a project in mind to create a second restaurant that would reprise these great dishes (especially the exquisite pasta dishes).
It was several years in the making and having found a perfect location, just across the street from Altura in the old Poppy space, Lockwood has opened Carrello to much fanfare. In a way Carrello feels like the old Altura in a larger space, with some extra quirks. The menu features the amazing pasta dishes that old patrons of Altura had grown to know and love but he has also added a sort of Italian dim-sum quality to the service.
Servers will periodically bring around carts with various delictations concocted by Lockwood, such as duck liver mousse from which diners can choose, if they wish, a taste. In this way Carrello allows diners to have both the a la carte experience with something of a tasting menu feel.
It goes without saying, the food is exceptional. One would expect nothing less from Lockwood, and the space is quite nice. It doesn't quite have the homey feel that Altura does and is a little spartan (I hope in time they can spruce it up a bit), but it's certainly a nice place for a lovely dinner with that special someone.
If you love high end northern italian cuisine, you must try Carrello."
Carrello,Carolyn P.,"We tried Carrello for a date night and could not have been happier. There is something truly delightful about the little carts that come around. We opted to pick and choose from the carts and order two pasta dishes to share. It was more than enough food, and I can see how you could make an entire meal from the cart snacks alone...and I just might do that in the near future. It was an incredible variety of items and I was impressed that each one seemed more delicious than the last. Definitely book a reservation if you don't want to wait or be disappointed."
Carrello,Neiha A.,"Excellent food!! One of my new favorite Italian restaurants in town. We were sitting right at the bar ( really friendly bartender.) We had vegetarian dishes Scarpinocc pasta and Farinata baked chickpea, OMG!! The flavors were outstanding.
For dessert I got the chocolate olive oil cake with caramel and hazelnut brittle, that was outstanding!!! My husband got the Cannoli which was ok.
Altura( across the street) is also owned by Nathan Lockwood. I haven't tried that, and it's on my list.
Overall great experience at Carrello, awesome food and ambience. I will go back for sure."
Cinque Terre Ristorante,Jennifer T.,"Have been here several times for team lunches/HH and I am always soooo impressed by the quality+ presentation of food, friendly service, and open/bright ambiance. Also love that they provide complimentary sparkling spring water and fresh focccacia bread (sooo freaking good, and did i mention it's complimentary???).
Most recently, booked this place for a team lunch and everyone really enjoyed their meals (including the vegetarians!). They have something on the menu to satisfy any type of craving/dietary restrictions -- from housemade pastas/pizzas to a variety of seafoods and steaks.
I ordered their seafood salad which was loaded with fresh prawns, octopus, squid, and clams. Very generous portions and fresh flavors!
Yes, the prices here are a bit steeper than your typical lunch fare in SLU, but totally worth IMO. Also great for larger group gatherings as they have a table in the back that fits 10+ people."
Cinque Terre Ristorante,Jared M.,"Great spot in SLU for some Italian food.
I came here for lunch and got one of their specials which was a pizza with mushrooms, buffala and mozzarella. I loved the pizza and there was plenty to save some for leftovers.
Will definitely come back here for a dinner or another lunch soon!"
Cinque Terre Ristorante,Shantanu G.,"We had a large-ish family dinner here.
Positives - polite and efficient waitstaff, attentive service. Very good wine list, the wine expert in our group managed to pick two really good wines at a reasonable price point ($40). A couple of the dishes were really good - the cuttlefish and the octopus items
Rest of the dishes were mediocre given the price point of the restaurant. These were more fitting of a mass market Italian restaurant."
Cinque Terre Ristorante,Dave F.,"Great happy hour spot. The bartenders and service are excellent. I loved the calamari, octopus and oysters. Nice wine selection.
I look forward to the next visit."
Cinque Terre Ristorante,Alexis M.,"Came here for my 21st birthday dinner. We had a party of 8. We sat at the ""Table 8,"" the semi private table in the corner of the dining room. The ambience was great. Definitely felt like we were in a private room. The food was amazing of course. The lobster was my favorite, it tasted so fresh. They also let us bring our own cake which was nice!! Definitely recommend for a private event!"
Cinque Terre Ristorante,Sophie S.,"Beautiful restaurant with great service and delicious food. We came here for my friend's 21st birthday and they let her keep a cake that she brought from home in the back while we ate. Our waitress was sweet and helpful when it came to recommending food and drinks. The focaccia bread that came with our food was incredible. Best I have ever had. I ordered the squid ink spaghetti with seafood and it was delicious! There were so many dishes on the menu that I wanted to try, so I will be returning to dine here again soon."
Cinque Terre Ristorante,Tanusree M.,"Super cute place for happy hour! Came here after work with a few coworkers. The happy hour menu is great. We got $10 bottle of rose! Amazing. We ordered a lot of food too, we got the cheese board, charcuterie, Margherita pizza, gnocchi, octopus and 2 bottles of wine. We spent quite a lot of time here and really enjoyed ourselves. The waitress was super nice and attentive. This place is perfect for a night out with the girls. Highly recommend!"
Cinque Terre Ristorante,MyAnne K.,Great restaurant. Great food. Great ambiance. Cannot believe I have not dined here before till recently. Was able to reserve a table 30 mins before leaving my house to walk over on a Saturday night. This restaurant offers a full range of options across the board from vegetarian/seafood/poultry/meat in all categories appetizers/pasta/secondi/carne. There is something for everyone. We ordered the octopus/buratta/Chilean sea bass/seafood stew. My goodness! Seafood stew was some of the best I've ever had served with a split lobster tail. Every bite was delicious. We also learned this restaurant is sister to Barolo/List/Mama Melina's. Dammmn! I love Italians!
Cinque Terre Ristorante,Christina C.,"Place is really packed during happy hour. Last time we came it was full and they didn't even offer us to wait so we had to go somewhere else. The next time we got lucky and had a small table. Pizza is really yummy, steak need more sauce, oysters were excellent. I really like the place but you never know if you will get a seat."
Cinque Terre Ristorante,Jonathan L.,We came here during lunch rush on Thursday. We were immediately seated since we had a reservation and got served bread on the table right away. The waitress was respectful about us needing to be in a rush due to lunch break. I ordered the Funghi Di Stagione pizza which was served in a timely manner. The mushrooms on the pizza were sufficient; however I thought it needed to be seasoned more since it was lacking in flavour. Also the dough was a bit on the burnt side which overpowered all of the toppings on the pizza but the cheese was very fragrant. Overall I recommend this place for Italian food but could be better with these suggestions!
Cinque Terre Ristorante,Maya D.,"I will preface my review by saying I do not like salad! Today I had the perfect salad with fresh baby greens, radicchio, and buttery Gorgonzola cheese, accented by fresh olive oil and fresh lemon. Can I say that I am truly a fan of simple food combinations.
Tonight eggplant Parmesan was the special. The chef prepared a plate of thinly sliced eggplant layered with mozzarella and fresh basil. Heavenly is the best way to describe my meal.
Topped it off with tiramisu (lady fingers soaked in coffee and amaretto). Probably the best I have ever tasted. It was not too sweet and just the perfect portion.
It was my birthday so it was served with a sparkling firework.
This is a great place for date night."
Cinque Terre Ristorante,Xinran A.,"Went there with my dad just to try their famous seafood soup and was not disappointed! They will split the soup for you if they know you are sharing, which is nice and convenient.
Each soup has a variety of seafood and the amount is decent for 20ish bucks/person. I really like the bread they put into the soup as not every restaurant does that and I particularly like the texture of bread after it was soaked in the soup and absorbed all the juice. They also gave you free baguette so you can dip the bread in the soup even more. However the soup does get cold pretty quickly and that can affect its taste and the dining experience.
We didn't order anything else and I was satisfied after eating. I think one appetizer + the soup will definitely make two people full, or just the soup itself might also be fine depending on your appetite.
The environment is modern and the service is on point. I would say this restaurant is good for either casual dining or for special days like anniversary/birthday etc."
Cinque Terre Ristorante,Ronda N.,"Italian done the right way! I ate here for lunch and was blown away by everything. The restaurant's decor is open, airy modern. It is bright and refreshing just like many restaurants in Italy.
The menu offers a wide range of meats, pastas, pizzas, etc.. The wine list is extensive with many that compliment the food.
My family and I shared a fettuccine alfredo appetizer to start. It was AMAZING!!! We then had minestrone soup, mix green salad before our spaghetti and veal meatballs. It was a guilt free meal made from the best ingredients.
The host and server were excellent. We had nice seating choices and our meals were timed perfectly."
Cinque Terre Ristorante,Duyen T.,"Perhaps I'm just not the target clientele for this place and that's quite alright! Definitely get the vibe that this place is pretending to be fancier than it actually is. I had a lunch here and expected some reasonably priced lunch options, but nope still experienced sticker shock. I had the appetizer size of the pulpo (octopus) and the waitress was very nice in warning me that it really is a snack size of 5 bites, and I appreciated the warning! So I fully knew what I was in for but it was still a bit surprising to see the plate in front of me. It was a dressed up single mini tentacle for $14. My coworker let me try her pesto pasta and it was a wee bit too al dente, almost to the verge of undercooked.
Pros: Delicious complimentary bread and olive oil for dipping.
I'll try coming back for happy hour and see if that changes my mind."
Cinque Terre Ristorante,Lexi H.,"5 star happy hour, 3-4 star regular hours.
Cinque Terre (and neighboring Barolo) are home to some of the best happy hours in Seattle. 50% off bar food and select bottles of wine (red, white or rose) for $20... (and a bottle of Veuve Clicquot for $48 is a steal) you really can't beat that for quality Italian food and fresh seafood. The happy hour is such a great deal, but I find regular prices a little spendy for the portion size (although I suppose you could argue the quality makes up for it).
The complimentary bread is seasoned and soft, paired nicely with a chili olive oil of some type. I recommend ordering a multitude of things to split amongst your group; the polpo is one of my favorites (keep in mind the happy hour polp is a very small portion, whilst the polpo Mario entree is larger and over mashed potatoes... YUM!). Happy hour includes a half dozen oysters for $11. For dessert, there are some classic Italian desserts, none of them to be regretted. I'm a sucker for good tiramisu, and theirs is light, fluffy and hits the spot. The food presentation and service is always top notch.
The ambiance is fine, though the decor feels a little too 'trying really hard to be modern and upscale' to me (but this could impress your guests if that is appealing to them) - and there's a small outdoor space you can sit in when the weather is nice. Note that it sits next to the main Amazon HQ campus, so it can be pretty busy for happy hours right after work Monday - Friday. Luckily, they have a late night happy hour that begins at 9 p.m., so if you can hold out until then, it's well worth it!"
Cinque Terre Ristorante,Sukhman T.,"The location was wonderful because it was right by Amazon headquarters. The interior was modern style which had a wooden stove, booth seating, bar seating and great lighting.
The waiter was very nice and ensured we enjoyed our food. He even got to know us better by having a small conversation. I would come back to try something else other then the pizza because was not impressed. The bread here is amazing and would come back for the bread they serve. We got seconds of the bread. They are known for their seafood but would have to ask a friend to try it and let me know since I am vegetarian."
Cinque Terre Ristorante,Yao H.,"Had dinner here after work. I arrived around 5:30pm and got the liberty to choose a table near the window. Great view and nice vibe. It started with complimentary sparkling water and bread with olive oil, both of which were great. I had fettuccine con gamberi al limone, which contained five huge prawns and various spices. It tasted really creamy and had different layers of tastes. It came in large portion and I could barely finish it. For dessert I chose tiramisu, and thought it was their special. It came with a little firework, which was awesome and made me really happy about it. The tiramisu was nicely presented, with fresh berries dotted on each corner of the plate. It was not bad, it was just average. Overall I enjoyed my time here:)"
Cinque Terre Ristorante,Kimmy L.,"My friends and I were craving Italian, so we went here for Seattle Restaurant Week.
The atmosphere was very modern and pleasant. We also arrived earlier than our reservation, but we were seated right away.
While I was perusing the menu, the waiter gave us complimentary made-in-house focaccia bread. The bread was good, but the olive oil lacked taste.
Since the Seattle restaurant week deal was 3 courses for $35, I ordered:
Appetizer- Spring Salad with dried lemon, cheese and walnuts
Entree- Seafood Cioppinno (Seafood in a tomato broth)
Dessert- Tiramisu.
My friend ordered the same thing as me, and we were both very disappointed by the salad. Even though it came with a dressing, it was extremely bland. I also thought the dried lemon was a strange salad topping.
The seafood cioppinno was the best dish of the three, although it was overly salted. They were generous with the amount and variety of seafood though. It had octopus, fish, clams, mussels and shrimp.
The slices of tiramisu were HUGE. It had a good creamy texture, but it only had slight notes of espresso. It mainly just tasted like whipped cream which was disappointing.
Service and atmosphere were excellent, but I was not wowed by the food here and will not come back."
Cinque Terre Ristorante,Kelly S.,"This is one of my favorite Italian restaurants to visit. Ambiance is great and service has always been good. Their pasta is cooked al dente and usually on point. Their HH is a good deal and in May/June, they get their mussels from Taylor Shellfish and have the best steamed mussels in Seattle!"
Cinque Terre Ristorante,Nicole L.,"I have now been here a couple of times ~ both times the atmosphere was perfectly poshy (I love to be fu fu every once and a while) and fantastic for socializing over wine and food with friends. Both times- the service was perfectly matched to the atmosphere. The servers were timely and not over bearing, giving suggestions of wine or food when needed, and always ensuring we enjoyed what we were consuming.
And while I enjoyed this restaurant throughly - I only gave it four stars due to the average cost of menu items , and how much I loved each dish. This is no doubt an expensive restaurant. The dishes I tried were good- just not super in love with them:)"
G.H. Pasta Co.,Tanya A.,"Went here in the summer, dragging my bougie reluctant sister who was looking to go to a nice sit down for lunch. I hadn't actually been to GH Pasta Co before, and I didn't know it was fast casual, but we were in a rush anyway, so I pushed that we try it out. My sister quickly shut up once the fork of pasta was in her mouth. The food spoke for itself. Didn't need to be anything fancy, sit down, or Michelin-rated...the pasta was so dang good it was in a category of its own; let's call this category ""Ain't 't Gotta Be Fancy To Win Mouths.""
Seriously, get anything off the menu, it's all delicious. Even the salads are awesome, if you're not a salad person.
Highly recommend. Not sure if Grassa is owned by SA aw company, but both are similar. Grassa is in PDX."
G.H. Pasta Co.,Yegee L.,"This restaurant is like a pasta factory, churning out fresh made to order pastas. It is a very small place so it's often hard to dine in and the line sometimes goes out the door. During peak lunch time around 12, it takes quite a while to get your order but the line dies down at 1.
The pasta is always very fresh, especially the tomato sauce options. The noodles are usually cooked al dente. They don't have a lot of options with protein but the two they have (spaghetti bolognese or gemelli w/chicken) comes with a good serving of their respective proteins. All of their pastas come with fresh grated Parmesan as well.
The truffle tonnarelli and the gemelli w/ chicken are quite rich & heavy. Even though I personally like the truffle tonnarelli the best, I do get tired of the strong flavor it has. If you're looking for a lighter more fresh option I would go with one of the two tomato sauce options spaghetti bolognese and the tomato rigatoni w burrata."
G.H. Pasta Co.,Tazeen L.,"Lunch spot with fresh pasta with interesting flavor profiles. This time around had the shrimp & chili bucatini which was tossed in a spicy, creamy sauce. Pasta was al dente and a pretty good portion, only part I didn't care for was the shrimp size which was similar to small salad style shrimp.
Place is pretty small with about a dozen seats, usually take it to go for al fresco dining. Worth checking out for a midday carb fix..."
G.H. Pasta Co.,Kamara S.,"The first time I came here, I was told that the worst day to come is Friday due to availability of ingredients. What days I come to this place... Fridays (yes I am a glutton for punishment).
As of fan of the sister restaurants (Le Messe, Haymaker, Raccolto, and others from General Harvest restaurants) I definitely wanted to try this one as it is for lunch and the prices for the pasta are relatively cheap.
This is definitely not a sit down place and while it has some seats, it is definitely a fast casual restaurant to probably buy food and take it to go. The place is definitely small that during the main lunch work hour it would definitely be packed.
There is a relatively small menu available but the options are good ones and the times I have been there, I see an additional special. Again, sometimes some options are unavailable due to availability (late Friday,
Prawns) but there are enough options to find something you would like plus one time they replaced a missing ingredient with something else and it went well.
It's a great way to get bucatini with clams or just tonnarelli with truffle and parm. Plus fried oysters or kale salad for appetizers (and relatively cheap). Plus, I am not mad at the portions. I could save half/a quarter after a meal if I want (but I am a champ)! Plus, they don't skimp on the cheese.
Overall, it is great for what it is. If there is space, you can sit down with a Pellegrino (blood orange) or a white claw (nothing too alcoholic because you may have to go back to work) and enjoy good pasta. Plus you get a map of the other restaurants in the company (not all of them are on there though)."
G.H. Pasta Co.,Sachi E.,"Good pasta spot near SLU. The lines get pretty long at peak times and the pasta takes some time to prepare. The pasta itself was pretty salty, but still good. They only list the main 3 ingredients in each pasta and exclude the fact there are onions and other bell peppers / veggies they throw in. I myself would have liked to have known that they include other ingredients for allergy info. That said, the pasta is good only if you like VERY AL DENTE NOODLES. if you don't, I wouldn't recommend."
G.H. Pasta Co.,Tani S.,"We have been here twice and have been impressed both times. I love heading to il Corvo but with my husband's office across town no chance for time for a lunch date with him.
The service is extremely sweet and I love the variety of the menu! I honestly don't know how they are able to cook so many interesting pastas.
Today we had the special of the day with tonarelli, rigatoni alla Bolognese (they were sweetly able to do this with rigatoni as opposed to spaghetti and removed chili pepper for my elementary school son), and bucatini with chili. All three were delicious--my favorite was the Bolognese. I could have this weekly and not get bored of it. The pasta was cooked to perfection.
This is fast becoming a new favorite the only drawback is I wish they had more comfortable seating especially for the price point :(. We lucked out and were able to get counter seats but have skipped out eating a couple of times when the restaurant has been overflowing."
G.H. Pasta Co.,Ariella P.,"Walking around Seattle can really work up an appetite! We dropped into GH Pasta Company based on Yelp reviews, looking for a fast casual lunch.
The space is very small and there is a limited menu. Don't let this deter you though, we really enjoyed our pasta. I selected the pesto (as I am a vegetarian) and my spouse had the bologonese. My one complaint about our experience here was the pasta was on the tougher side of al dente, tasted more like ""just cooked"" and less al dente we expected.
They are very generous with the Parmesan garnish, which who can complain about that? Yum."
G.H. Pasta Co.,Rebecca T.,"The pasta noodles themselves were made well and cooked al dente. However the pasta was just okay. We ordered the spaghetti Bolognese and the pasta of the day with tagliatelle (I don't remember what was in it).
There just wasn't any wow factor or anything that made me want to ever come back... However I may just be bias because I expect pasta to taste as good as il corvo and anything less is not good enough to me."
G.H. Pasta Co.,Alice W.,"Pasta here is decent and at a very good price, but definitely not close to il corvo in terms of the complexity of flavors. This store is open for dinner and weekends, though, so a decent alternative. Pasta is cooked to a perfect al dente, which I really enjoyed. The sauces are good but a bit muted/simple. We tried the spaghetti with bolognese and pesto. I like the bolognese better, especially since it had some spiciness. The pesto didn't have a strong basil flavor. We also ordered a piece of focaccia and the snap peas. The focaccia was nice and fluffy but because it's doused in sauce, the parts that weren't immediately eaten got soggy (so eat it right away!). Personally didn't like the snap peas. Half of it was celery and I didn't like that the cream wasn't fully incorporated so it was like curdled cream bits.
I would recommend stopping by if you happen to already be in the area but I don't think it's worth a trip if you aren't."
G.H. Pasta Co.,Marie B.,"Chef's Vendemmia is top notch. Haven't been to Raccolto. Le Messe is a toss up. Traffic - constant downtown Seattle face palm. Finally, visited G.H. Pasta located by nearby construction and parking hell late this afternoon (11/20/19). I cannot even fathom what this place is like when Amazonia and other downtown workers have lunch here.
The kitchen staff at 1400 were still slammed, like crazy busy! The slamming of dirty pans into the dish tub added to the din. High ceilings, bright windows with today's sunshine. Tight quarters counter space wise, but lots of takeout. Dirty counters (gave our area a good wipe down at the end). Empty water pitchers and initial icky red water glasses left around (eventually refilled with ice water once I placed them at front counter...note slammed staff).
Rigatoni with tomato basil and burrata tasty, but had to have The Homie polish it off at the end. He had the Tonnerelli with Truffle Oil and copious cheese. Rich and decadent.
I know it's practical to have compostable forks and bowls, but doesn't do the pasta justice when it's for here and not takeout. Very welcomed ice water once made available. Bus your area at the end. Treat it like a campsite. Leave it better than you found it, which we did. Eat it and go, no lollygagging here. Got a parting thank you as we departed.
For those pasta bowl cravings, still prefer Il Corvo in Pioneer Square, Pasta Casalinga at Pike Place Market, Due on Broadway/Capitol Hill, and Grassa in Portland OR.
Yet G.H. Pasta gets the job done, all things considered.
Hey chef, give all of the kitchen crew a well deserved raise! That is one heck of a culinary endeavor with a high volume throughput barely one step into the weeds."
G.H. Pasta Co.,Lindsey S.,"How can I say no to homemade pasta? I've had my share of homemade pasta from restaurants, and a lot of them are hit or miss. Sometimes the noodles are undercooked, and sometimes overcooked. This wasn't the case here - my noodles were cooked perfectly and had such a nice chew and bounce to them. I got the Bucatini with shrimp that was on their menu board, but was going back and forth between that and the Rigatoni. The sauce was creamy and spicy, with tiny shrimps scattered throughout. It was hearty, but not heavy, and just overall a good pasta dish, and maybe the best handmade pasta dish I've had!
The shop is super small, so there was a line out the door when I arrived, and line when I left, but I had no problem finding a spot to sit at. It seems that people just grab and go. After ordering, I waited five minutes, and they called out my number. It was hard to hear some of the numbers they were calling, because of the amount of people in the small space, but I was able to stand up front to hear better. They do everything in to-go containers, which I thought was interesting. They are sustainable, and most people DO take to-go, so it's understandable. Since it's so close to the Amazon Campus, lunch time is busy, but if you're looking for something to tie you over all day, these pasta dishes will do just the trick, just come early!"
G.H. Pasta Co.,Caroline T.,"Automatic 1 one star for having some 90s alternative rock blasting upon opening.
I'm not sure if they were behind because someone called out, or because of something else, but they seemed a bit rushed with opening/making sure things were out (ex: no forks at any of the seating areas). Cleanliness also seems to be a second thought, at least at the seating areas. All of the counters hadn't been wiped down, which was particuarly gross since the place just opened, which means it was left from the day before...
I was the first one in and only waited 10 minutes for my order. If you're dining in, they'll give you a little metal stand with a number and then you can choose your seating. (Plastic) Forks and napkins should be in the placeholders at the seating areas, and yes the pasta comes in the compostable bowls even though you're eating in. Once you're done, the recycling and compost bins are by the door, and there's a bin for any water glasses to be returned.
Thankfully the pasta was tasty, the sauce really was the winner. I went with the Rigatoni with Burrata, but found out after ordering they didn't have any but could sub in mozarella. Half the pasta was overcooked, but I'd prefer that over a soggy mess. Again, the sauce was really the winner and if they sold it I'd happily take home a jar. I was also relieved the sauce didn't have oil in it, as others noted some of the pasta dishes were swimming in oil.
With tip and no drink, my order came in just shy of $15. Not too bad considering this is Seattle, and it's within walking ditsance of the Amazon Campus and Space Needle. I may come back and try their bolognese, but I'd take it to go.
Lastly, I found it odd that even though I paid with a credit card the cashier was still typing in the details on the screen even though he swiped my card. Tad concerning when a cashier doesn't explain and the customer has to prompt them to.
Tips:
-Street parking (per the norm of the area), though be mindful where you park as the area has quite a bit of construction and is around several aprtment complexes. Thus, there may be stricter parking restrictions
-No set tip %, cash or credit is okay"
G.H. Pasta Co.,Kevin N.,"My oh my, what a truly special place this is. Located in Belltown, this new spot is making a serious case for best pasta in the city.
I came here on a Sunday afternoon for a late lunch. After ordering my food at the register, I was able to immediately grab a seat at the small shared table in the middle. Within 10 minutes, my number was called, and I went to the counter to grab my freshly made order.
I ordered the spaghetti with bolognese and an order of garlic bread. Typically, I'm not a fan of bolognese due to it being too sweet. However, this one was different. The sauce itself was very meaty, and it gave the dish a very satisfying, comforting feeling during my meal. And then the noodles themselves were so good. They spaghetti is thicker than the typical Parillo spaghetti you're probably used to, giving you a much more substantial bite. They were perfectly cooked to al dente - the outside still required a slight bit of effort to bite through, then the insides were super soft. They topped it with freshly shaved parmesan, which added a nice salty element as the cheese melted into the dish. By far, one of my favorite pasta dishes I've had in my life.
As if it couldn't get any better, the garlic bread was amazing. I got two hefty pieces, which was much more than what I was expecting. The bottoms developed a nice crust so that there's a brunch when you bite into it. And then the rest of the bread was super light. Topped with freshly shaved parmesan, definitely one of the best garlic breads I've had.
For how satisfying the meal was, it was very affordable. My meal was around $17, and I got a TON of food. Each pasta will cost between $11 to $14, which I think is pretty affordable compared to other places you'd go for fresh pasta.
The place is super small and located in one of the apartment buildings. It's tough to see from the outside, so be sure to follow your GPS. Inside, there's one small bar table that can seat 6, as well as maybe 10 additional bar seats. Wouldn't recommend coming in a big group, as seating can get pretty tight.
This is a super casual spot - no water service. As such, please be sure to bus your own spot. The bowls they serve their food in are compostable, and they have a tray for your used water cups.
Highly recommend this place - I'll be sure to come back to try other pasta dishes."
G.H. Pasta Co.,Ellen V.,Good place to grab some pasta to go. Lots of students in here with limiting seating. It can fit about 10-15 people or so. This is a really causal take out spot. The pasta is tasty. They have a limited menu and most of the pasta don't have any meat but still holds down in flavor.
G.H. Pasta Co.,Michelle L.,"This was my first time here. This is one of the only other pasta joints that is less than $13 per dish. We ordered the truffle pasta, and the spaghetti bolognese. Also with a side of the potatoes which were really crispy and delicious! The truffle pasta was so creamy and yummy i couldn't stop eating it!! But the bottom of my bowl was a layer of oil that was a bit sad. The spaghetti bolognese was good, I liked the sauce, a tad bit acidic, but the pasta was very al dente in a delightful way! For the price, this place is not bad at all, my friend I can with said Il Corvo is still better so I am determined to try that place! I'm glad this place is open on the weekends though, because Il corvo is not.
Parking is street only because this place is near downtown Seattle, and get there early or you
Will not have room to sit down! I would return here again, maybe try the pesto or something else!"
G.H. Pasta Co.,Mimi N.,"Good Italian food and fast service. Cheaper than most places in Seattle. Serve generous portions. It's a small place so I will usually order food to go. The Foccacia bread is the best and quite tasty.
They are open daily from 1100-1600, including weekends."
G.H. Pasta Co.,Melissa C.,"Food: ****1/2 | Service: *** | Value: ****
Yummy home made pasta! We tried the spaghetti Bolognese and daily special which has corn, arugula, and lemon. The Bolognese was amazing! The daily pasta can use a little bit more lemon in my opinion. I didn't give the food 5* because both pasta were a little undercooked. Despite this place is counter service, it takes a while to get food because they prepare the dishes as they're being ordered. Price is very reasonable ($10-12) considering the quality and quantity of food. I highly recommend this place if you're a pasta lover! @mocha_mel"
G.H. Pasta Co.,Elizabeth C.,"I've been wanting to try this place ever since it opened, and since I never come down to Denny Triangle anymore it's taken a while. It seems like a still-popular spot, as around lunchtime the line is sizable, but moves through relatively quickly. I waited in line to order for maybe 5 minutes? How long it takes for your food is pretty variable, though. It took maybe 10 minutes for mine, but I also saw large parties who ordered after us get theirs within 5 minutes, while my lunch buddy's food took more like 15-20. Obviously during lunchtime they are churning away, but just keep that in mind if you are looking for a ""quick"" lunch.
It's a counter service place where you can either get it for here (compostable containers w/o lids) or to go (same compostable containers w/ lids in a bag). If you can't finish your food, you can easily go up to the counter to get a lid and bag if you want. Silverware sits in containers on the few tables, as do napkins. You can serve yourself water as well.
Their menu is small with many seemingly permanent pasta items, a few appetizers, and a daily special pasta. I had the tonarelli with truffled sauce plus the fried oysters with aioli as an appetizer, while my lunch buddy had the rigatoni with tomato sauce and burrata, plus a focaccia topped with tomato, mozz, and basil. The portions here are pretty healthy, by the way; we both came pretty hungry and left very satisfied, appetizers or not.
The fried oysters were nice, but honestly not worth the price as they were quite small and they were only three that I counted. The tonarelli (a similar pasta shape to spaghetti) was cooked to al dente, well-coated in a sauce that was noticeably truffled but not one-note. As other reviewers have mentioned, this dish will reveal itself to be sitting in a pool of oil as you get closer to the bottom. I mean, yes, it doesn't look great, but just drain it out and continue enjoying it. A lot of these creamy white sauces combine cheese and oil to get that thick texture we all enjoy, so you're bound to produce some extra oil as the dish sits and cools down.
The focaccia my lunch buddy got was fluffy and delicious and came in a huge cube...and her rigatoni's tomato sauce made me feel like it was summer tomato season again.
Next time I would definitely try to get here earlier, but for the reasonable price on good quality pasta, I can see myself being a repeat customer."
G.H. Pasta Co.,Huong L.,"******3.5 star******
My sister and I decided to try this place as we were in the downtown area and it was walking distance and we were craving pasta.
The inside is fairly small and probably can fit maybe up to 10 people. It's counter service so you order/pay first and then they will call out the number.
We got the daily special and the zucchini salad. The zucchini salad was pretty tasty. Definitely like the dressing that they use. It has a subtle sweetness to it. It was refreshing.
The daily special was pasta with cherry tomato, garlic, Swiss chard and parmesan. The pasta was strozzapreti which kinda looks like udon, but not as long and a little twisty. The pasta was cooked perfectly Al dente. They put in a generous portion of parmesan so it was very cheesy. The flavor was good, but I had to drink a lot of water because it was pretty rich.
Each dish was very simple, but the taste was just ok. Portion was generous though and pasta was cooked well."
G.H. Pasta Co.,Tara D.,"This place has some of the best pasta I've had in Seattle! The interior is a bit smaller so seating can be hard, but the pasta is worth it. I got the truffle pasta, and the truffles were amazingly aromatic. Definitely recommend!"
Mondello Ristorante Italiano,Brian K.,"I'm super happy to have found a very authentic Italian restaurant right next door! My girlfriend and I walked here the other day, and we were both surprised about how delicious the food was!!! We had one of the linguine dishes with meatballs, which were just perfectly seasoned and cooked just right, moist and delicious. We also had the ravioli, also very well done and the seasoning and sauce were well balanced to allow the homemade pasta to shine, but still give the right texture and complete the flavor of the dish!
The only Con to this place is the 25$ Corking fee!!!!! OOFF! That one hurts, so in the future we will not be drinking when we come here, but the food has allowed me to keep this place at a 5 star review despite the ridiculous corkage fee.
Keep up the good work guys!"
Mondello Ristorante Italiano,Rebecca R.,"Came here with a Groupon still on the hunt for a go to or even return to Italian restaurant in Seattle. The staff was super friendly and observant. Food arrived promptly. No problems with front of house service.
My order: Insalata Cesare, Fettuccine con Salsiccia, and a glass of Montepulciano d'Abruzzo for my meal and then tiramisu and a cappuccino for dessert.
The highlights of the evening for me were the wine, tiramisu and cappuccino. The tiramisu was lighter than I expected (perhaps more whipped cream or whipped egg whites to zabaglione and marscapone than normal) but the flavors were SPOT on. Seems from the other yelp reviews that the dessert are on point, so props to whoever is making those.
The salad was ok; not bad but also not super memorable.
The pasta was the real challenge for me. I enjoyed the sausage and the general flavor profile; however, the pasta was extremely stodgy. Some pieces of pasta were cooked differently than others and not all of it was even fettuccine (I think some linguine snuck in there). Overall the cook was way off to the point that I just ate the meat and a few bites and openly welcomed the arrival of dessert.
All in all, if I was in the neighborhood, I might stop by for some wine, tiramisu, and coffee and there is a slight chance I might try a different type of pasta, but this is not a place I would take my family to or go out of my way to return to."
Mondello Ristorante Italiano,Kenzi H.,"This is one of my favorite Italian restaurants in Seattle. After visiting various Italian eateries, Mondello offers an authentic homemade pasta that takes me back to my time studying abroad in Italy.
I'm shocked there are not more reviews about this place! Mondello is a great date spot and a good place to take visiting family and friends.
The staff is always friendly and the restaurant is a hidden gem in the neighborhood. If you're in Magnolia for dinner - this is the place to be. I always order the Ravioli Marsala, it just melts in your mouth with each bite. I've also had the gnocchi and it's AMAZING! You just can't go wrong!"
Mondello Ristorante Italiano,Upasna D.,"Service was outstanding and decor was cute. Our server was warm and welcoming. Three stars because they only have two vegetarian entree options, both are cheese based. I asked the server if they are willing to customize and she said that they don't."
Mondello Ristorante Italiano,Ronald H.,"We still mourn the passing last month of Mondello's guiding spirit, Mamma Enza Sorrentino. But tonight's oxtail special showed that the kitchen carries on splendidly."
Mondello Ristorante Italiano,Ridhima G.,Mondello's food is authentic and of top quality. We came here to celebrate my brother's birthday. I called in advance and the older lady was able to bake a cheesecake for the 7 of us. The cake was delicious and so fresh! Thank you to the team for making sure we had a great experience.
Mondello Ristorante Italiano,Cruz V.,"Woah, this place was absolutely fabulous. The ambiance, server and food felt like a real life Italian experience. Perfect for an intimate date night. I want to highlight the spaghetti carbonara. I'd definitely go back!"
Mondello Ristorante Italiano,Nicole Y.,"Gnocchi Gorgonzola with ""special"" dehydrated ""chicken"" flown in all the way from the Arabian dessert. This chicken is so parched, you'll feel like you're lost in the Sahara with each bite. This virtual experience can be yours too for only $25 pr plate.
I was excited to try something new and the reviews here looked great--So, I figured I'd give this place a try. I've been craving gnocchi gorgonzola with chicken ever since I ordered it from Brunello Ristorante Italiano a few months ago and was complete wrecked by its deliciousness. But, my meal at Mondello was unfortunately disappointing. The gnocchi itself was not bad. However the gorgonzola sauce lacked flavor and the chicken was offensive. There's no way that someone who cares about what they do and the people they serve, would served anyone the chicken that came on my gnocchi. It was literally hard as a rock. It looked like a chicken topping from a dominos pizza delivery would look like after sitting in your fridge for three weeks. I don't understand why some restaurants send out shitty food via delivery. This is not entirely uncommon, though I cannot say it's a regular pattern at Mondello, as I haven't ordered from them but this one time. So many people order delivery these days, you would think restaurants would recognize that kill'n the delivery game would bring in loads of new customers. Unfortunately, the message Mondello sent me with my delivery, was that they don't care about their delivery customers or the quality of food they provide to them. I am not sure their food is better in house, but, I for sure wont be fooled into spending nearly $30 on a single entree of this quality from Mondello ever again."
Mondello Ristorante Italiano,Richard S.,"Mama hasn't lost her touch! My wife and I ate there last night. The antipasto was a meat lovers dream. A few veggies but mostly prosciutto, ham and salami - cut very thin. The spaghetti bolognese was simply amazing. When I go to an Italian restaurant I avoid dishes like spaghetti bolognese because they are so ordinary. Not this one! My wife and I were in awe of this dish so enjoy!"
Mondello Ristorante Italiano,Arthur K.,"When going through the list of Eater's ""Iconic Dishes That Define Seattle Dining"" article, Mondello was the one restaurant I didn't recognize. They listed their lasagna as their signature dish. I had a business meeting coming up in the Magnolia area so I made it a point to my coworker to make a stop here for lunch.
The decor is old school, almost stereotypical, Sicilian. I got their iconic lasagna while my coworker got the gnocci al gorgonzla. The lasagna wasn't just cut out of a pan and plopped down in an unappetizing square as I expected. It almost looked like it was individually baked to order (of course I know it wasn't) and then dressed with a delicious sauce. The pasta was very soft but not soggy at all. I can see why this dish is so famous now."
Mondello Ristorante Italiano,Amy G.,"My husband and I have been loyal customers of Mondello for years because it was the homey spot for good Italian food in our neighborhood. We were able to look past their fairly regular service blunders and mishaps, and the fact that the red wine was always served at 85+ degrees because we still felt welcomed and the food was plentiful and the quality was high.
But, after eating at Mondello a week ago, they have lost us. The family has faced the very sad loss of their matriarch, and the eyes on this restaurant now have a very different arrogance and focus on cutbacks for their own benefit. The place now feels like another manipulative Seattle restaurant taking sneaky steps to give you less for the same cost which will backfire as the experience and food quality has massively suffered.
We were made to wait for 10 minutes for a table even though we had a reservation. A pack 'em mentality. Newly implemented, bread is rationed at one piece per customer and refilled for a charge. Red wine is still served too hot, yet the price per glass probably exceeds the value of the whole bottle. Portion sizes have shrunk, now 5 ravioli where there used to be 6 and they taste nothing like they used to. Veal has been replaced with bread in the no-meatballs. I mean, come on! Isn't that like the oldest trick in the book?
It is so disappointing to see how greed has messed with was used to a pretty good thing."
Mondello Ristorante Italiano,Kati P.,"Well....the service was very good. The homemade bread was unusual and very yummy.
The menu was very NON-CONDUCIVE for vegetarians. There were only two items on the entree menu and both were cheese-based. It's 2019 folks......there should be MANY choices for vegans and vegetarians.
The establishment was kind enough to make both of us a simple pasta dish with lots of veggies. We both asked for marinara sauce and our dishes came without any sauce, but rather in a clear 'soup'. We asked for sauce and a very watery and flavorless sauce arrived.
Both desserts we wanted were out, which was very sad. Why are they on the menu, if they're not available?
The biggest shock was the bill. We were charged the same price for our veggie pastas as dishes with meat or fish. Who charges $52 for two simple pasta dishes with no animal protein? Ridiculous.
We will not be dining there again. We have Italian restaurants much closer to home with rich red sauce and prices that are reasonable.
We felt very ripped off."
Mondello Ristorante Italiano,K C.,"Mondello's is a little jewel box of a restaurant, and we felt lucky to pick it. Yelp reviewers, get to work. This restaurant needs to be higher on the list of recs.
Primarily pasta but homemade pasta it offers up fresh versions of favorites. My son had venison meatballs and I had pasta puttanesca. We shared an octopus appetizer that was incredibly tender. My only suggestion would be to offer some shrimp as an addition to the puttanesca.
The restaurant is charming and on the small side, but we will be back.
Visiting my son in Seattle three things are always on the agenda: dim sum, seafood and Italian. All three difficult to impossible to get in Flagstaff so we are two for three so far with dim sum and now Italian."
Mondello Ristorante Italiano,John E.,"They are back to being the great restaurant I had missed for a few years after the last bad experience there.
Any pasta on the menu he is killer."
Mondello Ristorante Italiano,Marie B.,"During my 'staycation', I revisited favorite sites in Seattle's Magnolia neighborhood, one of them being Mondello. As mentioned from other write-ups, it is one of those underrated, flying under the radar established restaurants. It was time to update my previous posts from 5/18/14 and 3/15/15.
Earlier this afternoon (11/26/17) I headed back to Seattle via Bainbridge Island ferry, texted family members to ask where a family member's birthday was to be celebrated. Coincidentally, Mondello came up while texting.
We all decided to meet up in Magnolia Village at a nearby indie café since Mondello didn't open until 5pm on Sundays. We showed up a few minutes shortly after opening, warmly greeted, and seated at the same 4 top coincidentally from previous visits.
The restaurant's matriarch, Enza, wasn't perched at her usual counter seat. But instead, we had Corino Bonjrada, Mondello's owner, do the personable meet and greet as we perused our menus.
Beverages:
glass of Rosso della Casa ($9), Orange San Pellegrino soda ($3.50, with refill), and plentiful ice water.
Starters included:
Warm slices of house bread with herby dipping olive oil.
Antipasto Misto ($16) which had cured prosciutto and Parma (?) ham, cheese drizzled with balsamic vinegar, but no olives present on the serving board.
Bresaola ($14) which was one giant slice of cured Painted Hills beef. I ended up poaching both the arugula with grated parmesan and the greens from the antipasto plate, this made for a tasty mini salad.
Zuppa di Lenticchie ($12) with flavorful lentils, homemade sausage served in a generous bowl.
(Note: This much delayed post continued on 1/28/18, over two months later. Checked and noted menu prices went up slightly compared to this November 2017 visit. Details now fuzzy and receipt faded, my apologies fellow Yelpers.)
Main entrees included:
Pesce del Giorno (market price, $35)
Ravioli Marsala ($18)
Spaghetti alla Carbonara ($18)
Desserts included:
Tiramisu ($9) with an espresso ($3)
Limoncello ($9)
Affogato ($11, but comp'ed by the owner)
The celebration continued when two flutes of Moscato d'Asti was also brought to the table, gratis.
For a spontaneous birthday dinner decision, this was spectacular success! Thank you to
Corino Bonjrada and all of his restaurant staff.
Grazie mille!"
Mondello Ristorante Italiano,Jeremy W.,Best gnocchi ever. Ever. Excellent food. Quaint atmosphere. Friendly family owned/staffed. So happy to live around the corner from them!
Mondello Ristorante Italiano,Latifa S.,"Surprise surprise!! So pleasantly surprised!!
I've knew about Mondello from their sister restaurant way back when several years ago! Just never trek it up here before. I mean I know La vita e Bella! I like the food!! Not crazy in love!!
But I guess this isn't the same! First: love the beautiful colors! Brought my mom for lunch here, we usually only do italian for family meals. Duh!! :)
Love: the gorgeous grandma that runs the spot! She's elegant! Spoke italian!! Si grazie!! Feel so home!!
Lunch menu was simple: fed appetizers! Several pasta and paninis. Pasta are basically traditional Sicilian dishes the classic like polpettes, carbonara and puttanesca. Nothing crazy elaborate! Though our neighbor tables swear by the ravioli in Marsala sauce! We went with our usuals!
Pasta vongole for moi! Always!! Love the wine and garlic parsley explosion!
Puttanesca with rigatoni has a nice kick!!
Fettuccini polpettes was good too!
Best part of all of this that got me squealed?? Fresh pasta!!!! It was love at half a bite. Ain't nothing like fresh pasta!! This is not the hand rolled but still it was perfect!! Usually I have to travel to my family in Rome for this much fresh pasta!!! Oh happiness!!!
I didn't even need my sauce to be honest!! Love it! So happy!! Too bad they don't have happy hour!! Or smaller plate options so I can try them all! Till then, grazie tanti per bella pranzo!!"
Mondello Ristorante Italiano,Amy K.,"One of the items on my culinary bucket list was squid ink pasta. This week I got to cross it off that list, thanks to the squid ink spaghetti with jumbo prawns dish I devoured at Mondello's.
Rustic and filled with the charm of an Italian villa, this restaurant hits the mark with its scratch-made pastas and cook-to-order entrees. The decor is Instagram-worthy and the vibe is like a big hug and kiss on both cheeks. While waiting a long wait for your food, you can expect a tableside visit by one of the owners and Mama Enza's homemade bread with garlic dipping oil.
I highly recommend the squid ink spaghetti, Mama Enza's lasagna and anything with seafood (their specialty). Mussels, specifically. Nothing is done in haste or on the cheap here, but if you can budget for it and aren't in a rush, you will walk away singing Bocelli."
Mondello Ristorante Italiano,Aaron M.,"Not a good night for Ristorante Mondello. A Big Rock found in the her seafood special by our guest. Spinaci soffritti had no detectable butter, lemon, garlic or salt & it seemed to be sautéed in a pan that was not hot enough with olive oil. Spinach should be Awesome in an Italian place like this. Mondello is not special or quite up to average in the Neighborhood Italian restaurant category. Were told they were out of bread After we talked about ordering a couple Mussel and Clam appetizers and After we ordered an $85 bottle of wine. Was told when I asked about a bread store, that a grocery store was across the school yard and had baguette. It was a Saturday night and a 8:pm seating, our guests hadn't arrived, I had time I walked to get baguette. The restaurant could of done this... the food was definitely Okay. The Canolli very good! The check included a 20% gratuity. Not cool as we were five plus one calm kid. Run and staffed by the cute Italian owner and her daughter(s). Not motivated or professionals. When the owner was showed the rock which was larger than a quail egg her response was ""no, no that's not a rock it's not possible to notice these in with the clams"" and after we ordered the Cozze & Vongole apps we we told they were out of Mussels. I don't know but I think Carmine Smeraldo would of thrown a fit of epic proportions, If he were in our place! We were cool about it all but it seemed the staff just wasn't into it."
Mondello Ristorante Italiano,Joe C.,"I moved to Magnolia very recently and have been already been to Mondello twice. The food fabulous - very authentic Northern Italian pasta (i believe all handmade) with good veggie options (important for me).
Not only is food yummy, but the setting is wonderful, with outdoor seating on sidewalk of quiet street.
Best place in Magnolia for a delish meal in European setting..."
Homegrown,Renee S.,"They've changed since I first reviewed in 2011. Different, but no less good. They no longer offer fries as a side, but soup or a salad, potato chips and yummy cookies. They also added bowls to their offerings. Splendid and more with the times as bowls pretty much rule the west coast, and for good reason.
As an unintentional mostly-vegetarian the hot pastrami called out to me, suprisingly. This place sources their meat from local names they're proud to name, so I thought about my B12 levels and went for it. I was not disappointed as my mouth let each bite dance around inside. Perfectly executed toppings, crisp yet fluffy grainy ciabatta and saucy goodness was chosen as a combo of half sandwich half soup. The stars were aligned for my tummy it seems because as fortune would have it their seasonal soup of vegan cauliflower curry was equally as good as the sandwich.
Homegrown is calling me back. Next week, Homegrown...next week."
Homegrown,jill g.,"OK, my kids love this place so much that we decided to give it another try and everything went well. And then we give it another try and another try and... Everything has been great. I love ordering from the website, it's easy to navigate the menu, easy to add or remove items, nutrition availability is there, they even let you know how long it's going to be for your order to be ready.
Ordering in the location it's self is also better, they have gotten much quicker and I believe they've got a nicer as well.
I love love love the Matcha chicken bowl. It's delicious, full of the good ingredients like chicken and avocado, and they do not skimp on anything. I think I could eat this every day and be happy.
My kids are in love with all of the different sandwiches, the avocado is always fresh, the bacon crispy, and the Beechers makes anything better."
Homegrown,Milton S.,"A really good local farm to table place. The last time we were here we decided that it was good enough to come back. You have to be ready for local farm to table menu. It definitely is not going to be for everyone. Which is good because that is what makes them special. The food is locally sourced for the seasons. This is the first time we are doing breakfast.
So if you are interested in something fresh from the farm, I would definitely recommend this place."
Homegrown,Neha M.,"I love this low-key neighborhood joint (albeit a mini-chain, but not all chains are bad) for their delicious sandwiches. Favorites - smashed chickpea zaatar, chicken pesto and plain old caprese. The french bread is amazing. Neat location with outside seating, fast service and ability to order online for a quick pickup make this a winner. Their bowls look amazing too, but I haven't personally tried yet."
Homegrown,Emily N.,"This place is great for some healthy options. I loved having a sandwich and soup lunch! A little expensive for amount you get, but I loved having lunch here and when in the area I'd love to be back!"
Homegrown,Lindsay H.,"I didn't realize this was a chain until coming on Yelp to post this review and seeing locations throughout Seattle...
In any case, I wanted very much to love this place. It's close to my house and everything on the menu sounds delicious (without being too unhealthy). Unfortunately I was let down.
As I waited for my to-go order, I watched a food prep gal behind the counter carrying around sandwiches and sloppily tossing them on trays. It felt very much like a fast-food employee slinging burgers, which now makes more sense knowing that this is a chain.
My salad/bowl appeared to be prepared with just as little care as the sandwiches. It had cabbage in it, despite my request for no cabbage. I was drowning in dressing. And with the excessive dressing + avocado, it had pretty much turned into a bowl of mush when they tossed it. It didn't look appetizing like the pictures at all. I recommend they combine the ingredients and let the customer stir/toss it themselves. I'll take responsibility for not requesting my dressing on the side like I normally do. All the ingredients were tasty (minus the cabbage), but the steak was about 80% gristle. I had to spit most of it out. Additionally, I assume they're called ""bowls"" rather than ""salads"" because they all include grains; however, the grains were minimal. It's a salad.
My last complaint is the price. I left having spent $20 on a salad and chips (plus small tip) that I would soon be disappointed by once I sat down to eat it at home. I don't have a problem spending $15+ on a salad, but it better be good and served to me at a sit-down restaurant. $20 for a subpar lunch from a fast-food joint seems outrageous.
Despite my disappointment and resulting low score, I'd like to give it another chance since the menu is appealing and I know everyone has a bad day. But I think, first, I'll spend my hard-earned money at healthy food joints that actually care about the service and products they're providing."
Homegrown,Mel M.,Yum! We love this place. The food is always so delicious and healthy. We've also typically had good customer service. Only docking a star because the prices are a bit absurd for what they sell. We used to go pretty regularly and now it's more of an occasional treat.
Homegrown,Mark A.,"Great Turkey, avocado and bacon sandwich. Everyone in our group loved what they ordered. Spicy braised tofu bowl, pastrami sandwich, Turkey about bacon sandwich and Chile soup. Great healthy lunch."
Homegrown,Aaron V.,"Homegrown is a really appealing, and healthy option with lots of options for drinks (coffee, tea, lots of healthy juice options for children). I love how most of the food seemed very health beneficial (I sadly didn't have time to look into contents of the food so I don't know for a fact though) I have no complaints about the taste of the food, however I do feel like the menu could do with more food options. It just kinda seemed like some of the same types of food, and there wasn't the same type of variety as I saw with their drink options. The location of the store is super convenient, even though it's difficult to find a parking spot, it's a nice place to just visit if your passing through. It's also next to some high quality coffee places to walk over to and pair with your food. The staff service was great, they had plenty of people doing plenty of things behind the counter and our food was done with quickly and with quality. Definitely would try to visit again sometime! Thanks guys
Side note: food was more expensive than you would expect for the small meals."
Homegrown,Tristin R.,Cute little cafe right on the corner. Lots of natural light gets in. Delicious healthy menu. Good amount of options. We ordered the turkey bacon avocado sandwich with a cup of the tomato bisque soup and the warm veggie grain bowl. It was all seriously quite delicious. The grain bowl had a little bit of a kick to it but not overpowering. The sandwich was fresh and high quality. Tasted extra yummy dipped in the soup. The soup was one of the best tomato bisque's I've had. Service was quick and staff was friendly. We will definitely come back next time we're nearby.
Homegrown,Phoenix R.,Good local chain. Healthy food. Tasty. The Chicken Pesto was oily. A bit pricey unfortunately.
Homegrown,Antonia M.,"Did I really just pay $18 for an ok sandwich and a 20 something to be indifferent to my existence? The food is ok but it's really just a glorified subway. The tables and chairs are always disgusting. There was 4 employees standing around and nobody but me and my baby in the shop. Nobody was cleaning and I had to drag my baby up to the back corner to get my sandwich. Not trying to be prissy, but if I'm paying that much for a sandwich, the least they could do is set it on my table! It really annoys me that this is the most convenient place to eat in my neighborhood. Everytime I eat here I regret not just waiting in line at Starbucks and grabbing a microwaved sandwich. I've had better service at McDonalds."
Homegrown,Lydi L.,"Fantastic food, the chickpea za'tar sandwich was fantastic, lots of great gluten-free/dairy free / vegetarian options! Riley was extremely helpful and knowledgeable about the menu:)"
Homegrown,Debbie A.,Consistently great food and service! Turkey bacon and avocado sandwich never disappoints..or any of the other offerings we've tried on the menu.
Homegrown,Nathan D.,"When walking in, you get a simplistic yet recycled with a splash of modern feel. The aroma subtle. When walking up to the counter the employees seem attentive and enthusiastic. Personally I am a usual there getting the bacon chicken avocado sandwich with the side of tomato soup this dish is simple yet complex in flavors. My only complaint is that the restaurants is a bit pricy."
Homegrown,Jarod B.,"I was super excited to try Homegrown for the first time! The sandwich was tasty, however when you pay extra for avocado at a premium price... you kinda hope it shows up. It didn't in this case. For the price i paid, I'd expect it to be there. Bummer deal."
Homegrown,Casey Y.,"Fast courteous service and the food is locally sourced and quite good! The price is on par with everything else these days but the ingredient quality is quite high.
The turkey sandwich and soup have been good and the staff have been accommodating the last few times I've visited. Recommend"
Homegrown,Amy L.,Food is really good but why is this place so cold?! It feels like there's no heat in there at all. The whole meal is like eating in a fridge.
Homegrown,Andy B.,"Can't even call an order in! Only online digital orders accepted...
It's my food, I'd like to have a two-way with someone about it
I'll spend my money where I can speak to a human being thank you"
Homegrown,Lucas W.,"WOW!! I will say this place is superb. The combinations they have and the ingredients they use just make me feel good, and man oh man, these sandwiches r delicious. It's one of those places where I would eat until I threw up. It's seriously THAT GOOD!"
